# Episode Numbering

Many episodes online (YouTube, Usenet, private/public trackers, the scene) are
misnumbered. **Just because a file/video is titled e.g. "S01E01" doesn't mean
it's actually S01E01!**

This episode guide is the most complete and accurate one on the Internet, at
least for seasons 1 through 34 (see [this
comparison](https://github.com/copsTvFan/cops-episode-guide/blob/master/guides-comparison.csv)).

# Episode vs. production numbers

- Episode numbers: S01E01, S01E02, etc. Typically given in sequence of airing,
  but not always! The production company likes to overcomplicate things.
- Production numbers: CP-100, CP-201, CP-1935, etc, plus special-specific ones
  like BOC-002, S-1301, etc. Season 1 production numbers start from 0, while
  other seasons start from 1, meaning that CP-100 and CP-201 will be
  respectively the first episodes in seasons 1 and 2.

Episode and production numbers for season 2 are identical.

# Objectively vs. subjectively incorrect episode numbers

Many files online have objectively incorrect episode numbers. People make
mistakes. Examples:

- CP-1923 aired at 8PM on 2007-12-15 and CP-2022 aired at 8:30PM. Scene group
  `2HD` released CP-1923 as "S20E14" and completely ignored CP-2022. As a
  result there's no scene release of CP-2022.
- S19E14 was similarly missed by the scene.

When episodes are banned, platforms like Reelz don't keep the original episode
numbering because they don't want gaps in their offerings. For example, they
shortened season 13 from 40 to only 36 episodes and shortened season 16 from 41
to only 36 episodes.

The situation with many other files is more complicated. For example, episodes
can air out of sequence:

- example: "Due to a change in schedule, episode 3129 will air at the end of
  the season. In replacement of episode 3129, episode 3130 will air on Monday,
  April 22nd at 10:00/9:00 pm central on the Paramount Network. We apologize
  for any confusion, due to in-house production processes, we decided to keep
  our episode numbers the same. This does not affect your regularly scheduled
  programming."
- example: [season 35](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Cops_episodes_(season_21%E2%80%93present)&oldid=1325923266#Season_36_(2024-25))

Scene groups will number episodes as they air. But TVDB, Wikipedia and others
will respect the intended numbering from Cops.

Platforms like Reelz and Pluto usually order episodes by their production
numbers, but they still use the `S__E__` (like `S20E01`) notation instead of
`CP-____` (like `CP-2001`), which sometimes confuses even themselves -- I have
seen cases where the episode titles (like "Dog Eat Dog", "Not Your Papi") did
not match the actual content because they were intended to be used with airing
numbers, not production numbers.

Another issue: should long episodes like "20 Years Caught on Tape" could as one
episode (S20E05/CP-2037) or two separate episodes (S20E05/CP-2037 and
S20E06/CP-2038)? They have two intros and two outros and look like standard
episodes.

All of this could have been avoided had `cops.com` maintained an episode guide.

# Objectively numbering episodes from the first 20 seasons

1. Play the file
2. Find the textual description for the first call. Example: `7:25 PM Hit and
   Run Accident`
3. Search for that exact string in [the guide here](/cops-episode-guide).
4. If there's exactly one match, you have found the episode. If there are
   multiple matches, compare the city and officer name(s) to find the correct
   one
5. Use the production number to unambiguously refer to the episode.
