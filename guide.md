**Broward County, FL #1 (1 Hour Pilot)**

- (Full 90 second theme) Burt Lancaster -- This program was filmed during a
  one-week period with the Broward County Sheriff's Department in Florida.  All
  Suspects are presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.
  Sheriff Nick Navarro says it's a unique area -- to the east of them they have
  the Atlantic, to the west a big swamp called the Everglades. Because of the
  fact they have a labyrinth of waterways it makes the place very appealing to
  drug smugglers.  That's where they face them on a daily basis. He goes with a
  SWAT team to a crack house, smashing the door and running in. One asks for a
  sledgehammer, they break a door, a man is down.  Watch it you guys, talk to
  me, back room is clear, double check them.  Bathroom is clear. A woman is
  down in the kitchen. Nick says it's one of the most disgusting sights, the
  garage is another bedroom where they sleep. There is the crack altar where
  they smoke it, paraphernalia where they smoke, down here is the toilet on the
  floor.  It's a bucket. This is a typical crack house, that's why the close
  them down. He is driving and hears on the radio about another officer taken
  down in the line duty by shooting. He says it always happens to someone else,
  not to you, can tell you one thing, he's been to too many funerals already.
  He's had more cops killed in FL in 1987 than the state of NY.  That's a
  tradition. He goes to the officer's funeral. There is a fire by his house on
  the way home. Nick goes home, asks his wife to get off the phone to call in
  about it. She hangs up. He asks about any flammables there, any potential of
  spread. If you see any potential please let him know and he'll head down. He
  hangs up, he's sorry, what a way to come home, that's the way it's been all
  day, another beautiful day. On the TV news they say it's the worst fire in
  the everglades, it's a chemical plant in the Port. Don from the news reports
  on scene.

  about it. She says she married him because he is a cop and thought their

  he'd have to kill her.

  is. Then he wants a warrant. Then he admits the bag is his. She arrests him
  and he goes nuts and starts fighting everyone and she goes down. They take
  him away and find he had a stolen gun and six ounces of coke.  He then
  calls his girlfriend and mom to tell them he's going away for a while.

  re-election speech while the Rocky Theme plays. He wants to make the county a
  better place. Trojan Horse Briefing.  Cops cut cardboard to make a big box to
  hide inside the back of an El Camino. Sgt.  Robert Deak says the dogs will
  jump out and get them, can fill the truck up with drug buys. Dealers learn
  what the tactics are -- never sell to a van or car with two people in it so
  they have to come up with new ideas. A black guy comes up and sells a rock
  for $10 and wants to sell another $10. They jump out of the box and get him.
  They go to a second stop and grab another black dealer. The driver jokingly
  wants them to let him know if the box falls off. Sgt. says it's exciting
  going after dope.  One day they get the dealers, the next the users.
  Different every day. It is now night time.  The dealer runs and they chase
  him, tackle him and cuff him/He thinks it makes you in touch with the
  community by stopping them from selling crack to kids. Deputy Willie
  Washington says the biggest lie is someone driving through a drug area saying
  they are lost. They stop a driver who says just that. He made a wrong turn
  off the freeway. He says he's heard lots of stories about District 2 -- lots
  of violence and shootings.  He didn't want to work there, was scared, but now
  likes it because of the people, they are great. The Lt. stops a car. The
  woman says she was looking for the ocean. They find drugs in the car -- a
  cocaine rock.  She says it isn't hers, she just wanted to go home. They ask
  how it got there. She says a guy she stopped for directions must have thrown
  it in there. Then asks if they planted it. They cuff her and put her in the
  back of a car. She wants the cuffs off.  The Lt. says to calm down. She
  won't.  He says she is going to the station and is going to be booked. If she
  didn't do it, tell the judge and if he believes it she'll be free. He reads
  her rights from a card. She can't believe he has a card. At the station they
  book her. He is really nice to her about it. She says again and again she
  can't believe there was a rock in the car and is totally embarrassed.  Deputy
  Linda Canada is doing paperwork in a diner with her fianc√© Deputy Jerry
  Wurms. They kiss.

  who want her boyfriend not to come back. The daughter cries and says she
  doesn't want him back.  There is also a 22 month old running around. He
  comes back and the daughter screams. She wants to go to a hospital because
  she doesn't want to stay there since she is scared of him and is only 7
  years old. He is arrested and wants the girlfriend to call his mom. Linda
  talks to the 7 year old and says he got drunk and almost hit her.  She
  wants him to stay in jail first for 2 nights, then 4 nights, 10 nights --
  forever since she is scared of him. They give him a trespass warning, he
  can't come back again. She says he is a good man when he isn't on drugs,
  cocaine or whatever. Linda says she needs to make up her mind, but will
  take the children if she doesn't provide a safe environment for them. Linda
  leaves and the girl wants to go with her.  She promises to come back
  tonight and tomorrow. Linda wants to take her out of the house, but most
  likely he'll be back tomorrow since he is the breadwinner and she is scared
  to be alone in the bad neighborhood and the girl will want him out again.

  This is the reality of the men and women who protect and serve in the Soviet
  Union.
- (6:30 AM Soviet Militia Training Academy) The commander explains what is
  needed to get in the academy. You have to be highly educated, knowledgeable
  in many areas, strong, physically prepared and often recruits don't realize
  how difficult their course is and can't make it through the rigorous
  training. The alarm goes off, men wake up, go to the bathrooms, wash up,

- (8:25 AM Combat Course) Outside men run up ramps, with fires set around them,
  bullets are fired, sirens wail, they go through sewers, under barbed wire, up

  targets.
- (9:00 AM Dress Inspection) They are in formation as they march in front of a
  podium. The commander says in his personal opinion only a real man can become
  a cop.
- (7:30 PM Leningrad) Alcoholism is a real problem, especially on national
  holidays when people want to celebrate.
- (May Day Celebration) They detain people who are drinking in public. In a
  park men have fallen over on the ground, they are pulled up and taken into a
  truck.  Their alcoholism is a big problem, their role is to get them

  van. People march in front of large pictures of Marx and hold up pictures of

  There is a small girl playing in the room. The people have nothing and can
  buy nothing.
- (7:30 PM Nevsky District) They spot a man wanted by police for smuggling and
  want to get him outside of his house so he can't warn his friends. They walk

  and tries to stop them. They quickly drive away. She wants to know what he
  did and where are they taking him.
- (8:45 PM Suspects are Detained at Police Station) An old woman hacks, coughs

- (9:50 PM Raid Suspected Drug House) They say to open the door or they'll
  break in. They ask a little boy who walks up if he lives there, if his dad is
  there and if he has a key. He says he does, he is, but has no key. One cop
  starts kicking the door until it's loosened. They file their way inside. The
  man says why should he open the door for them. He didn't want to, his house
  is his fortress. They violated his house. He's dressed and ready to go. They
  search the place and find pills. They crush it and dissolve it in the water.
  The kid climbs up on top of a cabinet and pulls down a bag and shows them a
  bottle of drugs. He's known it a long time and has reported it to the police,
  but they didn't respond and never came. At first he didn't know what his dad
  was doing. He looked in the slit of the door and say what they were doing.
  They were injecting drugs.  His parents have been divorced 7 years and his
  dad comes with his friends to turn it into a den of drug addicts. Let him be
  punished, maybe it is better for him to serve his sentence, maybe it will
  reform him and after his sentence, maybe he'll speak to him.
- (Good Friday Mass Leningrad) People in church light many candles and chant.
  They go to a murder scene. The homicide investigator is a woman who says his
  brother killed him. There is nothing unusual about it. He used a knife. The
  place is a mess.
- (Interrogation of Murder Suspect) At the station he says he was drinking with
  his friends on the street. He was drinking at home with his brother too. A
  witness to the crime says they fought and the younger brother said, "Now I
  will stab you to death." The man says he went into the kitchen, got a knife,
  came back and stabbed him
- (Easter Sunday) On holidays domestic disputes can lead to murders. A woman
  stabbed her boyfriend, there is foul play because the body was moved from the
  scene and put into bed. They talk to the woman who is older. They want her to
  tell the truth. She says she's very tired of life, just tired, tired of
  living like this. The man is in bed and they lift him up. She cries and says

  out. Back at the church the priest is leading a procession and lighting
  candles.

  out to their cars and bikes as patriotic music plays. A call comes to car 426
  to respond to trade school #16.
- (Knife Fight a School) It's between Russian and Azerbaijanian students. Some
  boys from the republic were studying in the school and the girls are always
  the center of the fights. It's the girl or the nationality. A man says they
  had a dance in their disco and he was responsible for the music. Then he saw
  a fight, stopped the music, ran over and saw a guy on the right with a cut
  vein. They are bandaging him up and people crowd the ambulance. One kid says
  it's his friend and he wants to go with him. They ask the man how come he
  didn't see who used the knife. He was playing the music and called the
  ambulance. There were people running all over. They talk to one kid and ask
  him to calm down and what's wrong with him. Why does he have blood on his
  hands? He just fell down, right there. His arm is cut with a knife, how did
  it happen? He goes to show them, then says let me go, I'm innocent. They take
  him away and go to the hospital to check the victim. The room is all stone,
  like a prison.
- (Crack Down on Motorcycle Gangs) People drive fast on bikes at night. One
  blonde girl poses for the cameras. The bikes are like Honda scooters. A cop
  says it was a big group who wouldn't stop, so they chased them and forced
  them to stop at the checkpoint so they could check their IDs. A few didn't
  have licenses or ID. So their bikes are taken and they are in trouble. Some
  are drunk and are checked out. The fine is 300 rubles, loss of license for 5
  years and 2 years at a correctional labor camp. They ask a man why he ran
  away from the cops. He felt like it and the cops are full of crap. They check
  a woman and she says not to touch her. They aren't, they just want to see her
  ID. One girl has a long tail attached to her helmet. She won't cooperate and
  they take her away. She had no license plate or ID. At the station they tell
  her to put her keys down, but she won't. They go to take her to jail and she
  fights them. She wraps her extending keychain around her arm and refuses to
  let them have them. She struggles and they say she won't get away and if they
  have her keys they are guaranteed she won't get away. They have her empty her
  coat and put her in a cell.
- (Rooftop Surveillance of Suspicious Cars) Cops climb up stairs and have
  walkie talkies so they can report down to the street. Other cops go down.
  Some stay and use binoculars. They check on a car that has been parked for 90
  minutes. As they pull up they people put on their lights. They go and ask for
  their ID. It is a little blue car with a large Bosch sticker on the front,
  two big cracks on the windshield and a woman driver who won't come out. They
  lock the doors and won't let them in, it happens often. She drives off and
  two cops jump on her car until she stops. They ask her what right does she
  have to drive with two cops on her car. She says don't yell at me, she won't
  give her keys, you have no right. He says he has every right, she has
  resisted the police. She is obligated to show her ID to the police when they
  ask. She won't come out or give up her keys, so one cop gets in and makes her
  drive to the police station.  Then they go to the house of prostitute who
  picks up men to rob them and serve her a warrant. There is a man there with
  no shirt in his underwear who says he's been working and takes them to the
  woman sleeping in the back. They tell her to get up and come with them. She
  says to film her and thanks them, they are doing lots of things to people,
  she is talking the truth, they want to steal from her and do what they want,
  either way she is going to jail, she will tell everything. She is naked and
  wants to get dressed. The man is proud of a painting he has by Restnatov of a
  woman and girls at a table. She combs her hair and says this is goodbye for
  good, how can she trust them, it's not possible, she can't trust anyone. She
  cries and goes back and gets her jacket and the cops are very patient. He
  says they are taking her away and will bring her back, not to worry. He's so
  tired, has no job. On the way down in the elevator she passes out. They say
  to get her some water, tell her to get on her feet and help her up, she can
  walk and take her to the station. She admits what she has done was not very
  nice, it was the first time it happened to her, she is afraid no court will
  want to hear her case. She had no judgment of her own caution when she
  visited a house, stole money and is ashamed to have to look into the face of
  the man she stole from. They put her in a dark stone cell.
- (2:00 AM Officers Off-Duty) Cops sit and cook huge shishkabobs on an open
  fire in a field while one of them sits on a log and plays a small acoustic
  guitar and sings Russian songs. They sing along to the second verse: "We may
  not drive fancy cars, but you can not get away from us. If you are thinking
  of committing a crime you better stay out of our way. If you are thinking of
  committing a crime you better stay out of our way." They keep singing as the
  credits roll.

  where's the search warrant, it's not here. They tell her it is. John talks to
  Ron, he says he wants to make it easy, there is no heroin, just what he's
  using. He gets the heroin from Mike Williams. John says he knows where he
  gets it. He used to get it from Jerry, but he's in Las Vegas, on vacation.

  give it to them. He lost his wife 2 years ago and wants them to tell the kids
  he's OK.  He buys from Miguel in Hillsboro. They want him to call Miguel and

  have him call Miguel and start the game all over again.

  everything. The car doesn't interest them though, it doesn't meet their
  requirements. It's a nice old colonial house though. Mike limps around, says
  he lived there 11 years and is going to have to sell it. He takes him to the
  safe where the combo is right 3 times to 73. John opens it and asks, "it
  won't blow up in my face will it?" There is a bunch of money, some rocks, not
  much. Mike calls Jose to make a deal. John says he has to make a decision to
  take his kids to a foster home and is it the best things for the kids? They
  just lost their mom, maybe they'll take the kids for a little while to wake
  him up. John is upset and can't even count the money. It's a tough call. It's
  not the normal house of a heroin dealer. John asks Max the neighbor to watch
  the children while Mike is in jail for a few hours.

  sanitizer. The other guy is booked on criminal trespass. Barry says he'll
  have to worry about it for the next 10 years. Back at the station he calls
  the clinic for information on the needle prick. They tell him the changes of
  getting AIDS are a couple 100 to 1, he's got a better chance of getting
  hepatitis, but he's gotten shots for that.  It's an officers worst nightmare.

  gets banned from the park. They have to make an example of him. Back to the
  black guy, James, they find pot residue on him. He denies having enough to
  make residue, not even sure what it is. The officer laughs and just bans him
  from the park. Officer Frank Klejmont says they've had the fair since 1970
  and people go nuts and act stupid. They exclude people from the park and they
  come back and get charged with trespassing. Officer Norman Sharp questions a
  guy with a concealed knife. The guy says he just came there for fun. He's not
  allowed there because he's drunk and has a weapon. They search another guy
  who won't tell them his last name and starts to get loud.  They tell him to
  quiet down or else there'll be a problem. They stopped him because a bulge in
  his clothes might've been a gun. Two guys are drunk and fighting and a bunch

  problem. He won't have to go to court if he needs to avoid a problem. They go
  to a nearby bar and find the woman. She's a tiny, skinny skank who denies
  making threats. He says the first person they'll look for is her if they have
  a problem with him. He says they are tired of her. She says she's sick of
  them. He says he's never talked to her before, but arrested her when she was

  trespassing to keep her in jail longer. She curses them out. He asks if she
  knows how serious this is. She says she isn't going to start fires and she
  didn't go over there. She's drunk again and they says that's the problem. The
  man wants to know how long she'll stay in jail, he has to think of his

  the life, but has come back. He tried to help her and now will arrest her.

  doesn't want it.  Harry says he'll take the kid if she stays there. She says
  she'll prove him wrong. He says the baby can't make the choice.

  down before. He says he didn't do it and doesn't want to go to jail, he was
  pulling his pants up. He apologizes and says the girl is his wife, she says

  go full bore on him, if he finds enough he can go federal and Bob can get 10
  years. Bob says he isn't the guy, they should know who he is getting it from.
  Lane says he might know who he is, but needs his cooperation.  They check his
  trunk, it's filled up by a large speaker. They find a shotgun inside and he
  says it doesn't work and is old. There is a handgun in the front, but no dope
  in the car. He has a wad of cash on him.
- (1:15 PM) They take him back to a hotel and have him make a call to his
  buyer. He wants a half and tells her to be careful. John tells him they will
  set the call up for 1pm tomorrow. If he doesn't show up he promises that
  he'll come down hard on him.  He didn't show up and a warrant issued for his
  arrest.

  the package is for her. John tells her to be very cooperative. She says she
  will. John says if she is truthful she can stay home, if she jerks them
  around, she'll be going to jail. In the back they find a drug scale and bags
  of coke. The women says they are not heavily involved in coke sales, the
  maximum she sells to is to 10 people a day, not $1000s a day.  John asks
  where she got the coke. She says a guy named Mike. John asks what would
  happen if she called him. She calls to make a meet for an ounce. John sets up
  a meeting -- it never ends.
- (2:27 PM) John says the guy is en route. When he shows up, grab them both and
  he'll meet with Lane. The guy shows up in blue and black shorts. He and a
  woman go up to the house. Once they go inside the cops run to the house. The
  girl has a cigarette in a death grip as they cuff her and take her out. They
  ask Mike where he gets it from. He says the guy they busted, Bob Park. Lane
  asks where he is. He says he doesn't know directly, but he'll make a deal
- (9:45 PM) They set up a meeting with Bob at a car wash. They jump him and he
  growls and says OK. John yells at him that they told him not to screw around
  and he learned his lesson. He has a bag of dope and a couple bags in the van.
  Bob gets a bloody lip in the struggle. John says he wants to search his van
  and apartment. Bob says there is nothing, same as last time, he wants to talk
  to his lawyer, then says to go ahead and look. The van is gross, covered in
  filth. John says it's 2:30 AM, it took 12 hours and 2 arrests later they are
  still going. John's favorite saying is, "You gotta be tough to live out
  west."
- (Street Patrol) Portland North Precinct -- Officer Becky Wooten takes the call
  of a stolen bike that comes in to 911. She says a neighborhood boy stole it
  yesterday, she got it back, but now she doesn't want to mess with. She goes
  to the house, talks to the mom, says he did it before, but doesn't know the
  house where the bike belongs to. Becky has been there before and says if he
  comes back to call them and they'll take it. Call even if he doesn't have the
  bike. Kevin is a young black kid in a Nike soccer shirt who comes walking up.
  She cuffs him, says he's going to jail and he cries. She mirandizes him and
  puts him in the back of the police car until he calms down. She says she
  talked to his mom, she knows. He says Milton told him to take it. He can't
  take stuff because people tell him to. He'll be the one that goes to jail..
  She tells him she'll think about taking the cuffs off. She closes the door on
  h m and leaves him there. Becky tells the mom she doesn't want him to know
  there isn't much that they can do to him. She keeps him back there and drives
  to a house looking for Milton. Becky goes to Milton's house on 18th, says he
  stole 2 bikes and took them apart. Mom goes in and finds Milton, he says
  Kevin isn't a close friend and tells him he doesn't want to hang around with
  him or go to his house anymore. They dare each other to steal. Becky says if
  they hang out together she'll arrest them both for whatever crime the one
  does. Milton asks if he's going to the judge and he'll be good. Becky says
  she isn't unarresting him, just giving him to the custody of his mom and the
  paperwork is on it's way. She takes him home and if it works, that's one less
  7 year old off the street.

  olds' purse, finds condoms and wants to contact her parents to see if they

  because she crawls out of the car, up on the roof, her dress goes up and she
  curses out the cameraman for 10 seconds street. She's totally high and it
  takes a few cops to calm her down. Harry gives her to a female to transport
  her to juvenile. She fights, rolls, struggles, screams, says get off of me

  won't tell then kids are gone. The woman agrees and leads them around back

  says she knows why she's getting arrested then yells "What?" really loud. He
  says the tape case and magazines are his and wants to know why they got
  pulled over. No front license plate. She starts crying in the back. He is
  free to go so he grabs his stuff and walks away. Bill finds an exacto knife
  kit in a wooden box, a vial of meth inside, a butane pencil torch and a glass
  crack pipe. She used to be a model and they find a folder of glamour shots of
  her posing in lingerie. Bill says she used to be a pretty good looking and
  she's not anymore.
- Central Jail -- Sgt. Grant Burnett says the advisory
  committee on adult detentions will be inspecting them, so make sure they
  polished their shoes, get a haircut and are squared away. He reads off the
  assignment list for search, P&R, etc. and they head out.
  (3:40 PM) Deputy Gene Bursch is assigned to gate duty. The first guy gets one
  chance to go along with the program.  They'll take the cuffs off and if he
  sits in the room for 4-6 hours he'll get no charges, if not he gets a padded
  room for 12 hours. They hand out bags to put possessions in.
  (4:45 PM) They ask the guy if he ever wanted to kill himself, he says yes,
  but not tonight. He's been charged with oral copulation and sodomy, $60,000
  bail. He'll get a chance to post it, but most likely won't be able to.
  (6:20 PM) A man says they picked him up at the YWCA and they tell him to be
  quiet and he'll get out in a few hours. He wants to know something.  They
  tell them they don't know anything. He says they are the fucking police, they
  should know. He and his pregnant old lady have been all over the US with no
  problem. They say he should stay out of San Diego. They search a guy on
  crystal meth. They can get violent, paranoid and attack because they think
  people are out to get them, especially the druggies. He says he slammed and
  shows where he did it. He sticks it in the breasts of a woman on a tattoo.
  His heart rate is 104 bpm, he says he's not using though. It's instant
  exercise.  They look in the drunk tank and people are whooping it up. One guy
  spits on the door. Another guy, Wayne, says he hasn't done meth in a week.
  They say he's tweaking and lying. They put him in a padded room and he says
  "Why me?" They smell pot and a small Mexican and a black guy in the drunk
  tank are smoking it.  They pull them out and search them. The joys of
  alcohol, a typical Friday night.
- (7:38 PM) Eddie the transvestite is brought in, he's a regular and is wearing
  a tube top, white hat and looks like a cross between Vince Neil and Cher. He
  is charged with possession. They check his arms and he has a huge scar where
  he shot up at 3pm. He says he'll be out in a few hours, maybe more since he
  looks so cute. They show guys inspected naked in the shower. William is
  brought in for being drunk. He's down on the floor and says he can get up.
  He's the Duncan Man and not turn his arm and hurt. Gene tells him to shut up.
  He won't open his mouth or follow the program. Gene says he's not going to
  make it. Eddie is fingerprinted. An old black drunk is let out, free again.
  He says maybe he drinks too much and maybe he belongs in jail. They say
  they'll see him tomorrow, he says maybe later tonight. Bill says all he had
  was a couple of beers. He has a bloody fat lip and was beat up. They go to
  inspect him and he fights and goes down. Three cops are on him and he starts
  screaming like a girl. They tell him he's heading for the rubber room. He
  keeps howling and says he'll cooperate. He leaves a big bloody spot on the
  wall. He says the cuffs are hurting him, but they can't take them off because
  he's fighting. He says he isn't fighting.  (9:07 PM) A guy in solitary tried
  to kill himself by wrapping toilet paper around his chest and setting on
  fire. Gene asks why he did that.  He says so he could get pain killers. Gene
  says it'll hurt twice as much with the burns.  A Mexican drunk is brought in
  and wants to go home. Gene says to click his heels together three times and
  say, "there's no place like home." They guy actually does it and Gene says
  drunks are so funny. They say goodbye to Eddie and they'll see him next week.
  Welcome to County jail gentlemen, step on inside.

- (5:05 PM Child Abuse Unit) County Sheriff's Dept Northern Division Warrant
  Briefing -- Detective Mike Radovich says the people across the hallway in #40
  are their victims, 2 girls 6-7, thought the suspect was a little weird. He
  babysat them a couple months, then he started molesting him. She could always
  smell ether coming out of his apartment and he tried to show her XXX movies,
  but she wasn't into it. They could smell bottles cooking. They are looking
  for naked playing cards he showed them, a movie showing a foursome and adult
  magazine. They are taking everything. Deputy Bill Hubler goes along.  (6:00
  PM) They pull up with a vanload of people. Inside they tell the people to get
  facedown. There is a young girl there. Phyllis says they are looking for
  Mike, she doesn't know where he is or when he's coming home. There's a knife
  on the couch along with VHS pornos. There's a stolen car in the garage plus a
  meth kit loaded with needles and some have blood in them. They find the
  magazines too. If he was there he'd be arrested. (7:45 PM Subject Located)
  They pull him out of his car at gunpoint. There is also a male passenger in
  the car. Both are cuffed. He's wanted for sodomy.
- (Northern Division Street Patrol) Deputy Bill Hubler goes to Fox Point
  apartments around the back and meets Deputy Victoria Reden there. They go up
  to apartment #23 and a naked woman opens the door, says her boyfriend John is
  in the bathroom, doesn't know his last name because she just met him. She
  puts a red robe on. They have a warrant for John Nickalopolous. He asks what
  he did now and he doesn't have a gun, so they look for it. Then Bill finds a
  guy drinking in the closet that looks Jim Martin from Faith No More. He's
  pissed and glad he wasn't armed, or Vietcong or he'd be dead. John says the
  gun is in the closet where the guy was, so Bill feels really stupid. The
  woman points to where it is and he finds it. She says she's sorry and is
  innocent. Everything went well, it was a 9mm, good thing he wasn't a killer
  or he'd be dead. God watches over fools and cops. (911 Call Female with a
  Gun) Someone saw a person hand a gun to a woman who stuck it in her clothes.
  They grab a guy in a leather jacket and a Motorhead shirt. The girl is
  dressed like Debbie Gibson in a flannel shirt, gray jean vest and black felt
  hat. She has a black plastic Uzi toy on her. She says it's her sons as the
  guy eats an ice cream bar. Bill calls to a cop across the street and asks if
  he'd shoot him over it. He says yes. The woman says she bought it as a gift
  for her son. They take the toy away from her, the guy says he guesses he
  learned his lesson.
- Astrea Division Air Support -- Deputy Ron Cowan is the pilot. They fly to a
  field in the middle of nowhere and there is a truck there. (5:20 PM Patrol

  comes from a man who hasn't heard from a neighbor in a while and went in with
  the key and found him dead. They find him on the floor next to the bed with a
  pillow over his face. He was last heard from on Saturday. He's in his 50s and
  was known to pick up young boys for gay sex. Detective Mike Bumcrot checks
  around and finds gay video tapes. His friend was worried, called the realtor,
  got the key and came in. The say it must be someone he knew because she can't
  get in the building. They find his hands are cuffed and they cut them out.

  Mercedes was stolen along with his wallet. They want them to arrest him. He
  says the 23 year old brother was driving the car. (7:20 PM Homicide Bureau)

  Cathedral in Vegas. (4:30 AM Suspect Arrested) They go and get him. The

  Reno to get him, but they are glad he came back and it's over.
- West Hollywood Sheriff's Station (Training Evaluation) Deputy Sean
  Collinsworth talks to Deputy Paul Terrusa about his second month evaluation.
  His total score is 2.8, better than last time, but some areas weren't. His
  broadcast skills are good, but when answering the calls he's not listening.
  He's the closest unit and he doesn't hear it. The armed robber he took down 2
  weeks ago was superb. Uniform and attitude are excellent, his saving grace.
  If it wasn't for his attitude he would've shot him a long time ago. (911 Man
  with Gun) The suspect was there before and the victim saw a gun, left and
  came back. They play a video tape dated 10/19/89 and it shows the guy coming
  into the tow yard and when he turns to leave they see the gun in his back.
  They wait outside for the guy to come back and they go in with guns drawn.
  There are four Asian guys inside and they ask the guy in the white shirt
  where the gun is. The other three aren't with him, so they let them out.
  Paul checks him out. The guy says it was a pipe, not a gun. He was pissed
  because they towed his car. He came out and his car was gone and he looked
  for it for an hour. He says he threw the pipe out. Sean wants to look in his
  van.  He says OK, but it's not his van. A second guy says he has a BB gun in
  his car.  They find it and it looks like a .45 caliber. The first guy wants
  to tell his point of view. Sean says his point is mute. They say a fake gun
  will get him killed.

  he gets certain jobs, but they worry too. He's brought his fianc√© out with

  because he's got good training. (11:49 PM Assistance Call) A call of 6 male
  blacks trying to beat up a transvestite comes in. He instead goes to a call
  of three men detained.  Joshua is 19 and has a wool hat over his eyes. They
  want to see if they are the ones causing trouble. Deputy Brian Hickey is on
  the scene. His American Express Card says James. He says that was a card he
  just found a minute ago and was going to throw it away. Brian asks him why he
  would do that and not turn it in.  They call in to find out if it is stolen.
  He says he didn't use it, but it's a misdemeanor to have it. They check him
  to see if he has others. Josh wants to know if he'll get in trouble for
  finding it. He says no, you should call it in or give it to the police.
  Common sense says he would try to get it back to the owner. Josh is on
  probation for second degree robbery, he did his time and is that going to be
  a problem? Josh is arrested for receiving stolen property and they'll contact
  his probation officer.  Another Case solved.

  The city, the gay and business community asked them to come out to arrest
  hustlers because of the crimes associated with them. They'll only make right
  turns and the signal is to put the blinker on. They are going to do it
  different then before by using a limo. Inside the signal will be to pick up
  the phone and say, "Let's go to the hotel." Deputy Jim Campbell says to give
  him time to play the guys as he'll have to string them along longer than
  normal. Aldo says once you do the passby turn your radio off and say, "You
  are going to try to go for it." They have to stay off Santa Monica and use
  Fountain until they get something to do it that way. (9:30 PM) Justin walks
  up asks what's going on. He says he's a man of the world, would you like to
  see a lot of it and get in. He does and says he's from Sicily. Jim says he
  comes and goes as he feels as they go on Detroit. He says he's a working man,
  charges $60 and can get anything he wants for that. Jim asks what he likes.
  Justin likes BJs and giving it in the ass. He asks if he likes hotels, motels
  or the back seat of the car. He says this is good. Jim says he'll call his
  driver and they stop, run out and bust him. Justin asks doesn't he have to
  have money to be busted?  The second guy is a young Hispanic who asks Jim if
  he's a cop. Jim says does this look like a cop car. He asks to prove it. How
  can he prove it? Let him in.  He goes to kiss Jim and he freaks out and the
  hustler knows he is a cop. He tries to get out Jim asks is that a game you
  lay, he's a man who moves a lot of money, he doesn't give kisses, he's
  bewildered by it. Do you usually do that, jumping in the car looking for a
  kiss? Does he always do that? No. He says he looks for something quick, not
  kissing. He says he finds him attractive. Jim says he hoped he would. He asks
  about a price and the guy says he's not interested and gets out. Jim says to
  send any of his friends over that might be. Then he says this guy is good.
- (11:38 PM) A guy walks up and gets in. he says he's Steve and shakes his
  hand. Jim says he wants to get to the nitty gritty, time is money, you've got
  places to go and things. What are you hustling for? He says he gets different
  amounts like $50. Jim says what does he get for that. Then a guy comes over
  to the car and asks if anyone famous is in there. Jim says one at a time. The
  guy says he likes to give BJs and he doesn't have a hotel to go to. They go
  north on Orange to Lexiginton. Jim asks about him. He says he's 20 and from
  Ohio. He wanted to come out and get into acting, but he got strung out on
  drugs. He wants to save up for AA to get off drugs.  Then he'll have his
  pictures done and get an agent. They pull him out and Aldo says Fred
  Hennicker says they busted him before. Jim wants the guy who went to kiss him
  (11:52 PM) Eric D'Angelo gets in dressed in drag. He is from Mexico and tired
  of it. He keeps talking, then cops bust him and he just stares. Jim says he's

  a penis? Yes. (12:15 AM) An old guy gets in, says his name is Snake.  Jim
  thinks he's Steve. He asks his first name and he says Clint. He asks if Jim
  is heat. He says does it look like it. He says they try anything. Jim asks
  what's on the menu. He says for $50 he'll do anything but S&M. Jim says
  anything for $50. Then he picks up the phone and says it's not a good spot.
  The cops bust him and say he has coke on him, they know him, he's Earl
  Jackson, he was just released from jail an hour ago after doing 6 months.
  They laugh at him and tell him to pick another line of work, he's not good at
  this. It's the 14th time he's been busted for it. Will he get a bullet, a
  year this time? It doesn't matter, as soon as he gets out he'll be back doing
  it again.
- Beverly Hills Municipal Court (9:05 AM Two Weeks Later) Deputy Jim Campbell
  is called to speak in the case against Earl. His job is for West Hollywood
  Sheriff's Department, been there 24 years. On 10/21/89 he was working a
  project for male hustlers. What does that mean? Deputy District Attorney Lisa
  Hart questions him. She asks what that mean. He says he picks up makes for
  sex. She asks if he was plain clothes, in a limo. Sgt. Powell was the driver.
  He picked him up on the corner. He asked him what is he doing and asked to
  get in. He moved over, didn't come in and came around the other side and he
  told him he surprised him.  He asked if he was out hustling, he's a
  businessman. He charges $50 and will do whatever you want. Chief Medical
  Officer John H. Clark gets up next. He's from the LA County sheriff's dept.
  They ask him about drawing blood for HIV analysis. He says Mr. Tribble is
  HIV+. Public Defender Michael Masterson asks if the test can be assumed from
  the results alone that the patient has AIDS. He says that is correct. Can he
  assume from the Smith Klein test that he will get AIDS. He can say for
  certain, but everything they know says it is a great chance he will get full
  blown AIDS. Det. Brown is next up. He first saw him in the West Hollywood
  jail and interviewed him there. Did AIDS come up? He initiated it. He told
  him what happened on the arrest and he asked him if he had AIDS. He said he
  knew 6 weeks ago he had AIDS. He asked him why he was still soliciting if he
  knew this. He doesn't care about anyone else and hopes they will all get it.
  As a result of the preliminary hearing the suspect was charged with felony
  prostitution. The case was later dismissed by a superior court on a
  technicality.

  Terrusa is up first. They egg him on, saying it's a 200 pound thief trying to
  take his gun away. Sean says it was good. Sean is next and wails harder than
  Paul and pokes with the baton. They yell to give it a good pop, take it
  seriously, jab it, he's making fun of your balls. There are all posters of
  pin up girls on the walls. (12:38 AM Man with a Gun Call) Sean drives up, a
  boy flags them down and they run over on foot. They cuff Joseph, a

  her husband, they don't live together. He lives on passage. She went to his
  house, buzzed him at the gate and had three bags for the baby. He didn't have
  his key, got mad, hit her in the chest and tried to pull her wedding ring
  off. David says they'll have to go back since it's the city of Paramount and
  get a cop from there. She's working two jobs to take care of the kid, he's
  not giving her any help and is being a rudie-poo. She went to drop the kid
  off because it's his turn for visitation and she needs to go to work. They go
  to the Todds' house and yell to open up or they'll bring the K-9 up. He
  doesn't answer. David kicks at the door over and over, but the dead bolt
  holds it. They yell for Todd to come out. They let Chubby kick it a while.
  Eventually they get in and the dog goes through, but they don't find him. The
  paramedics are called for her because her arm is swelling up, her ribs might
  be broken and she's thrilled. They cart her off and say he's arrestible now.

- (7:45 PM Shooting Call) Sheriff's Dept. Homicide Bureau -- Sgt. Ray Verdugo
  says they are seeing a lot of homicides, a vast increase. Last year was a
  record-breaking year in the entire county and this year they are ahead of
  last year. There seems to be an underlying sense of frustration and anger
  unleashing real rapidly, people seem to have a shorter fuse and are more
  angry about lesser things. The wrong look will kill you. He often sees it as
  fame or infamy. If you can't be famous, be infamous -- try to assassinate the
  president. Be known in your own crowd as the meanest guy or the guy who shot
  and killed someone. It's a tragedy. If he had the job and the education maybe
  he could give you the answer why. On patrol he says it is a warm, beautiful
  night, very comfortable, one of those unfortunate things that brings people
  to southern California. There is a murder in the Fireside station on Hopper
  in South Central. Detective Dave Castillo and Deputy Tanya Edwards are on
  scene.  She says the guy and his 6 buddies were dancing and having a ball
  with their shirts off. Then 8 guys came up to them and told them to put their
  shirts back on which they refused and a fight ensued between all 14 of them.
  One guy pulled out a semi-automatic, then another came out. One is DOA and
  there are 7 injured. The mans body is in the street and they take pictures.
  His sister ID's the body. Several witnesses come forward to talk to them
  including people involved and hopefully the suspect, but it's a pipe dream.
  He's an 18-19 year old youthful looking guy shot dead in the street for no
  reason. He took off his shirt, was dancing at a party and someone took
  offense and shot him dead. It's ludicrous, but a sign of the times. A guy at
  the station says the shooter fired 3-4 shots at Marco. Another witness says
  in Mexico quite often they take a stand of revenge. If someone kills a good
  person, they seek revenge to kill them. He is only 15, but would kill him if
  he had a gun. A man is killed and a cousin will hunt them down. They don't
  judge, but if they apply customs from another land, this person will get
  justice if they don't get him first. Some friend or relative will get him. If
  he goes back to Mexico, they will kill him.
- (2:45 PM) South East County -- Sheriff's Station (911 Call Choking Child)
  Deputy David Halm takes the call of a baby having a seizure inside a
  supermarket. An employee has her, but doesn't know what to do. He takes the
  girl and puts her on the ground. Emily is breathing, that's good. He tells
  her to stay awake, don't close your eyes. Fire rescue arrives. Her heart is
  beating, no pupil reaction and she's been sick. They give her oxygen, the mom
  is crying and they tell her to be calm so the girl doesn't see her and
  freakout. They put her on a stretcher. (5:20 PM Warrant Briefing) LA County
  -- Detective Armando Rea says it's a who dunnit case. A man was on his roof
  and saw a neighbor at 2163 Briarcrest with his power tools that were stolen.
  (5:35 PM Warrant Served) They go to the house and pull out two men, a woman
  and two girls. The girl says her dad Mike went to a storage yard. In the
  garage they find a bicycle, weed eater, two heaters, an American toolbox and
  Christmas lights that were stolen. The victim arrives and carts his stuff out
  never thinking he would get it back. His grandma gave him the lights. He was
  in San Diego while his house was being fumigated and he was robbed. The wife
  has no idea what's going on, no idea about any stolen equipment. Then Mike
  pulls up and she screams like she's being killed and yells "No!!!" They pull
  out guns and make him stop. He surrenders and is cuffed. They got them all,
  it was a good stop.
- West Hollywood Sheriff's Station -- Deputy Sean Collinsworth goes to a
  cleaner during a full moon wearing a large nose and glasses for Halloween.
  The cleaning will be ready Friday. He says the glasses tickle. (12:17 AM
  Street Patrol) Sean wants to get a picture of Deputy Paul Terrusa with a guy
  dressed as a zombie in the street. They both get pictures with a man as a
  silver robot. A man as a French maid cleans them.  They get shows by scantily
  clad women to the delight of the crowd (911 Suicide Attempt) A guy tried to
  kill himself. They arrive and a woman says he just went down... the elevator.
  She has blood on her arm from him. They go downstairs and she runs out the
  door barefoot. They come around the corner to a shirtless, white long-haired
  guy who cut his wrist. He has no knife and says he's unhappy.  Sean asks
  about anything particular. They call the Fire Dept saying he's on first floor
  in the back. Sean eats an apple while talking to him and is totally unphased.
  The guy has dozens of bracelets on and wants to go home, but they have to
  take him to the hospital. He says they have other business and should leave.
  He gets a little bit bummed out in life like they all do. (2:20 AM 911 Call
  Man with a Gun) They go to Jeff who says he overheard on the intercom that

  under treatment. He says no. They don't see anyone coming at him. He says a
  woman walked out of her apartment with her dog. There was a figure in the
  front corner of the apartment, he has his left arm up right now. His finger
  was pointing at them, he had a gun and they zoomed in on all fours. He heard
  the man call in, he said homosexuality had to be stopped at all costs. It was

  to a multiple murder shooting of three people at Direct Liquor. A witness
  says four people got shot. He just waited on the victims, they are dead face
  down in the street. He's been working there since 1965 and this is the worst
  thing he's ever seen. Sgt. Rey Verdugo arrives and Deputy Dana Vilander
  explains what happened. Two kids came up, words were exchanged and the
  shooting started. A guy and a girl went down outside and were DOA. All the
  shots were fired outside. Two Mexicans were hit inside, probably dead, now
  removed. The witness was working there behind the counter and couldn't hear
  outside, but everyone started leaving and he saw what was happening. The guy
  inside said, "Piru" and they asked why he said that. He went outside, was
  hit, came back in and fell down. It's a gang fight between B13 and G13
  Gardena 13 gangs. Two Mexicans pulled up and they told him they don't bang.
  They got shot at and two customers were hit on the way out. (1:56 AM Homicide
  Bureau) Detective Jerry Jensen questions Sherry, a black woman with a huge
  afro. She was walking out, they were walking in and they bumped into her boy
  and he asked what was going on. A guy pulled a gun, he called him blood and
  that was it, he had blood in his eyes. She is trying to remember how he
  looked, he had a baby face, possibly a thin mustache and thinks she can ID
  him.
- Lennox Sheriff's Station -- Rey Verdugo says this is a definite hit from a
  guy in the South Los Gang.  (3:12 PM Homicide Investigation) Three out of the
  four have now died. They went to the location looking for a Gardena 13 gang
  member.  It's what the one guy said that caused them to open up. What they do
  know is to talk to kids congregating and see what they heard. (Field
  Investigation) Two guys say Little Wolfie died and his brother Wolfie went
  back for justice.  They don't know who this guy is. (4:02 PM Crime Lab) They
  remove a large slug from the dead black female. They have two bullets they
  want analyzed from a Rossi Revolver, Astra, Colt, or Dan Wesson. (10:11
  Monday) They went to the house and retrieved some guns. (1:25 PM Ballistic
  Lab) One of the guns is a Wesson. They say the gun has no prints, but
  ballisticaly it matches up. They went to the G13 gang and they said Osvaldo
  Renrossos AKA Little Wolfie did it in retaliation for his brother's death.
  Ignacio Morina was only 13 and was going to join the gang and idolized Little
  Wolfie. They got photos and took it to their three witnesses.  The woman ID's
  him right away and so does another witness. A member of B13 said that night
  he saw the shooter. He wasn't going to help him and off the record he said it
  was Wolfie. (One Month Later Suspect Arrested) They pulled by his house, saw
  his car there, went up to his mother and got him with no problems.  In the
  station there is a Robocop poster on the wall. Rey tells the guy he has
  rights. He says he didn't do it, but knows about it. Rey said they will
  verify his story one way of the other and they want to be sure of a murder
  filing.  It's multiple murders with the death penalty attached. He denies it,
  but all the witnesses say he did it. It's him beyond a reasonable doubt.

  David Halm says a woman isn't breathing on Compton Blvd. It's trailer #2. EMS
  arrives, but they can't get in the door. They hear someone screaming inside.
  David slams the sliding glass door with his Billy club and a woman screams.
  He tells her to open the door, it's the police and is someone is having a
  heart attack. She says she is now. He's glad the glass didn't break. The old
  white woman says she didn't call. She was watching TV until 9pm and went to
  bed. EMS checks her out, 140/100 blood pressure. She asks if that's high.
  They say considering, it's pretty good. It seems a kid called it in, so it
  was a just cruel joke. She thanks them. (911 Call Drunk and Disorderly) They
  stop a white guy in a cowboy hat next to a white car. He says he has a
  license and shows it to David's partner. The guy says he has had something to
  drink and thinks about it -- a bottle of beer and 3 mixed drinks.  He has a
  Budweiser shirt and sounds totally drunk. Where is he headed? He's not sure,
  he's going to his basement apartment around the corner. He says he wasn't
  going to drive. They tell him he better not. He says it won't happen. He was
  inside a fast food place and was drunk. No one saw him drive, he says he
  wasn't driving, so there is nothing they can do. Minutes later they swing
  around after getting a call that he drove away. If they find him they'll
  arrest him. They spot his car around the corner swerving down the road. He
  hits a curb and stops. Dan told him not to drive. He pulls him out, says he
  has no weapons and gives him a field sobriety test. The guy says he doesn't
  know if he can, the ground isn't level. They take him to a paved lot and have
  him walk a straight line, which he can't do. They arrest him, take him to the
  station and give him a breath test. It comes out .202 -- double the legal
  limit. They put him in a cell. The breath is always lower than the blood
  would be so he probably has a .22 or .23.
- (7:20 AM Warrant Briefing) Antelope Valley Narcotic Bureau -- Deputy Dennis
  Ingersoll says they want a lightweight meth dealer, male white, 30 years old
  and the informant says he carries 9mm. Tony takes the back, Carl takes the

  and announce, then bash the door in. There are four people sleeping on the
  floor of the living room. Carol says she is going to faint, starts to shake
  and doesn't live there. The guy with her behind the couch gets up and puts
  his pants on.  Wayne, the owner of the house is cuffed. They have a search
  warrant. They cuff the other guy too. One cop finds a bunch of 1/4 grams of
  meth wrapped in papers.  They bring the guy with no shirt into the kitchen.
  They hear he's dealing and he was found sleeping next to it. He says it's not
  his. They bring Wayne in the kitchen and ask where the stash is so they don't
  have to tear the house apart.  He says he doesn't have a stash and doesn't
  deal. He's told an undercover bought from him personally two days ago. Now he
  wants to lie to him, he didn't just fall of the turnip truck. Wayne says he
  doesn't want his house torn up, but he has no stash. They'll tear up every
  inch of the place until they find it, how are they supposed to trust him? In
  a woman's purse they find an 8 ball, crank and a syringe. The phone rings and
  Dennis answers it. He says Wayne is tied up right now. It's his boss, he's
  late for work. He tells him it's the sheriff's department, he's under arrest.
  He can come over and secure the house for him if he wants. He doesn't. Wayne
  isn't coming into work today.
- Lennox Sheriff's Station -- Sgt. Robin Sawyer says Detective Holbrook has
  info that the Buchannon family ripped off some Columbians on a dope deal and
  they are going to even the score. The Buchannon's are arming themselves with
  automatic weapons and will be carrying them when they go out. If they aren't
  familiar with the family talk to Holbrook. (3:29 PM Drive-by Shooting) They
  leave and head to a street under construction where a black man in a blue
  shirt is down and a crowd is around.  The fire department arrives and a woman
  says he's her brother, doesn't know who shot him or why, he just got home
  from work. EMS works on him, gives him oxygen and he's not happy about
  getting a needle. They say he was just shot, a needle is the least of his
  worries. Deputy Bruce Vallerand talks to a witness. The guy says it looked
  like .32s. One was a .38 and the passenger shot him. They are a couple of
  drug dealers. The big guy got shot twice, the skinny guy shot once, neither
  are going to die, but it's definitely gang related. (4:37 PM Disturbance
  Call) They go to a Korean grocer and the woman says you'll shoot me. The guy
  says he wanted to buy a hat, he told her it was $10 and got mad. They talk to
  the black guy. He says he didn't want any trouble, he just wanted to change
  the hat. He goes to Cal State, bought a bunch of stuff, went to wear the hat
  to the basketball game, took it out and saw it was all worn. He came to get
  his money back and she said no, it's been worn.  The cop says to give him
  another hat and they can all leave. They want to give him the money back, but
  he doesn't want it, he wants the Chicago Bulls hat.  They pull it down from a
  display and he says it's fine. Robin says they come over to this country and
  try to make a living. The only way they can survive it to keep it open 20
  hours a day from 6am to 2am. There was a communication breakdown and they
  think they are getting ripped off, it's a couple hours pay to them. To us
  it's not big deal.

  mean looking sawed off shotgun. He carries it for two reasons -- drug
  rip-offs and cops. He has a floor plan of his house drawn on a chalk board.
  John is the ram man, Bobby is the #2 man. If a shooting occurs the paramedics

  gated door is open so they run right in yelling, "Freeze or I'll kill you!"
  They hear someone go out the back and give chase. There is a storage building
  in the back that is open and they check it. There is a lot of garbage in the
  back and a large brick wall he might've jumped. They find the sawed off fully
  loaded in the closet. They like the gun and it has lots of shells. They also
  find a bunch of aerosol cans including one Fix a Flat that they unscrew the
  bottom off and it's full of three bags of coke. They saw the same thing at

  walking their dogs and saw the public forum and decided to drop in. They
  heard several people in the yard and saw the police and K-9s in their yard
  and asked what's going on and they yell at them to stay inside and shut the
  damn door. Deputy Paul Terrusa says he's been there before yelling in the
  heat of the moment and later he goes and apologizes. Sean says that's all
  they want, it's amazing how far "sorry" goes, so they wouldn't be at the
  meeting. (1:20 AM Traffic Stop) Sean tells the driver to turn the car off and
  get out. The driver gets out and is very drunk, he doesn't listen well and
  won't interlace his fingers. He says he had only two beers. Sean takes him
  over for a field sobriety test. He has trouble closing his eyes and putting
  his head back. Then he has him count and lift one foot and he can't do that.
  Sean asks if he has any medical problems.  He tries the other foot and can't
  lift it for more than a second. He says it's the first time he's done this.
  Sean then demonstrates the heel to toe straight line and he messes up the
  count. The guy says he's the cop, he can let him do it over. The guy can't
  even put his heels together. Sean says he passed the last test, he's under
  arrest and cuffs him. They find a huge machete in the car and the guy wants
  it, but they say no. The passenger is also drunk and Sean tells him to start
  walking home. He keeps mouthing off, says he knows his rights and wants to
  know where his friend is going. They keep telling him to take off, but he

  the bullet is still in the skull. They show the x-rays. The victim says he
  was driving east on Rosecrantz, he heard a shot and was hit once. He didn't

  wife and child and brought them. She comes in to see him and is hysterical.

  in a wooden box. Another guy comes out and they give her the warrant to
  search the place. There is a sign that reads "Attack cat on duty." The only
  way to get into their "house" is a wooden corridor connecting the trailers
  that is filled with trash. The woman gets up and they make her sit down, she
  says it's probably her husband's brother and her son Mike beat her up. They
  say it is such a mess that they want her to show them where the drugs are. He
  can't go back in there because it smells so bad, the worst he's ever found.

  People are people whether they are criminals or car thieves, it doesn't
  matter where you work, there's law enforcement to be done. He stops a car and
  Brian the driver says he's never been arrested before. Gary says he has two

  it's Saturday night, time to go to jail. The dealer is an obese white guy
  with a mullet in a fancy white pickup truck. He's so big they need 2
  handcuffs and might even need 3. They find a wad of cash and high quality
  cocaine off a kilo brick. The size and type leads them to believe he is a
  dealer and they write up a search warrant, present it to Judge Lawrence Mira
  and go to his house. (1:45 AM) They arrive at the judge's house, he signs it
  and Gary swears on it. (2:40 AM Warrant Served) They bang on the door and get
  no answer, so they kick it in.  They find an ounce of coke in the closet, a
  shotgun and shells in the bedroom.  They started their shift at 5pm and now

  know they are going to state prison so they won't go out and rip off cars.
  Deputy David Halm listens. (5:40 PM Traffic Stop) David spots a car with no
  registration. He pulls out Robert the driver who knows his headlights are
  out.  He says he has no guns or drugs, he just forgot to put the lights on.
  He wasn't putting anything under the seat where they saw him digging, but
  they find a pellet gun there. He likes to target shoot. They find black face
  makeup in the trunk. He says it's from Halloween, he doesn't clean his car
  out much. Dave asks if he's doing any robbery. He says no, but has been in
  jail seven times.  He was arrested for meth, but hasn't done it since the
  last time he was in jail. He has a massive key ring with hotel keys. He says
  he just picked them up and collects them.  He claims he owned seven cars at
  one time, but there is more than seven sets of keys. They had a robbery a
  couple weeks ago by a man in black face. They don't know all the details, so
  they'll take him in to run him.  He claims the makeup is for his kids'
  costume. (7:15 PM Robbery Investigation) They go to the supermarket that was
  robbed a couple weeks ago. They find a bagger who was there that night. He
  said the guy had a painted face and a gun.  He didn't see the gun and he also
  had a fake beard. A woman says he showed the gun in his jacket. It sounds
  like their suspect so they go back to the station and read the report. The
  guy left on foot, was wearing makeup, possibly a white male. They are going
  to book him for robbery.
- (8:11 PM Multiple Shooting) They are looking for suspects wearing masks who
  had AK-47s. They picked the suspects out and executed them. David pulls up to
  a body shop and there is blood and guts on the street. Deputy Eric Stewart
  was first on the scene. One guys' leg was blown off, another guy was shot in
  the gut and his intestines came out.  Deputy Fred Bertsche talks to one guy.
  They were watching Star Search, working on their cars, putting a radio in and
  then the shooting started and he split.  EMS comes in and treats people. EMS
  says the first guy was across the street with an ankle wound, two guys were
  by the Pepsi machine with one with a head wound and the other was
  eviscerated, a guy was by the car with his stomach shot open and the fifth
  victim got over the fence and cut his foot open. Sgt. Cole Hughes says they
  chased the people through the parking lot and fired at them.  They found a
  308 shell, a large round. A woman was on the phone calling the police and
  heard someone yell, "Where's the money? Get on the floor!" One had a red rag
  in their pocket so it seems gang related.  They had a gang shooting two weeks
  ago where kids shot at cops with AK-47s.  They think they know where the guys
  are. It's ironic that up on the wall is a Crimestoppers security alarms sign.
  They install them in cars, but not on their own door.

  there, 5-10 minutes. It's a possible 5150. The man rang the bell, makes loud
  complaints and curses. They spot the guy walking with a red bag and they go
  out to talk to him and he fights so three cops jump him and hold him against
  the car and cuff him. He says, "Ow! Ow! My little animals, there are little
  animals in the red case. They look dead, but they're alive. Ow! Ow! Ow! I am

  he's on medication. What kind? Anything he wants. His lawyer's name is ouch.
  They transport him to the hospital for a 72 hour mental evaluation since he
  is a danger to himself.
- (6:10 PM Arson Investigation) West Hollywood Sheriff's Station -- Deputy Sean
  Collingsworth says 93 to 95 Tom1 he's taking over the call. Deputy Jeffrey
  Fine is on the scene. He's training a rookie partner, Deputy Paul Terrusa, so
  he wants him to take it. Jeff had them all get outside calmly, the fire is
  contained to the east side of the building and is almost out. Paul talks to
  the man who runs the building. He thinks it's electrical from the kitchen. He
  needs to fill it out like a 39. The fire department talks to one of the
  female workers who says one of the shelves with the cookbooks was on fire.
  She thought they could put it out, but it just erupted. She takes them into
  the burned out room to point out the books that were stacked up and on fire.
  They are to call immediately to say it's possible arson. (7:40 PM Narcotics
  Investigation) They look for a black guy named Tree and find him on the
  street. Paul checks and cuffs him. Sean finds some little baggies on him and
  the suspect says he collects stamps and that's what they're for, also for
  jewelry. There is meth in the bags, but he says he just found them. He's
  arrested for a 2020. (8:50 PM) They take him to jail for a strip search. A
  snitch told them he was a speed dealer. He says he's used and shows his arms.
  They find a bag taped to the inside of his shirt that has speed baggies in
  it. This is what they expected.  (1:50 AM) Sean says this is Paul's last
  evaluation. He's rated competent. He's made lots of improvements with codes,
  rules and procedures, it's his first 3.0, tremendous improvement in all
  facets of his training. Field performance is excellent, it's good because
  he's coming inside next month as the watch deputy so he'll be watching him.
  Congratulations and best of luck.
- (4:31 PM Patrol Stop) Lennox Sheriff's Station -- Sgt. Robin Sawyer tries to
  stay out there and monitor all the calls for service and make sure they are
  answered in a reasonable amount of time. He waits for the hot calls and rolls
  on those, evaluates the deputies on performance and doesn't want them to take
  unnecessary risks. Out there they do a real good job, everybody enjoys
  working there. He stops and talks to prostitute who has been beat, robbed and
  shot. She says no one's done that. He asks if they don't pay is it rape. She
  says no, she always discusses payments in advance. She's on a crutch and her
  left foot is in a cast. They shot her and robbed her of $1100, then the next
  time they took $400.  She didn't know she was shot, she heard that a bullet
  wound doesn't hurt, but it hurt. There was a hole in her shoe, it went
  through the first and second toe, went up and broke it in 3 pieces. She's got
  someone to rough him up. She won't call the cops because the girls will beat
  him up. He says let them take care of it. She says they hate her. He asks her
  if she wants to get off the street. She says yeah, but how? He says to work
  with him and arrest this guy, get the SOB off the street. She says to talk to
  her tomorrow. She's going home to change because no one will pick her up
  since she looks like she's handicapped. They just won't do the right thing.
  Robin went to his 30th high school reunion and everything's changed. They
  took all the trophies out of the display case and replaced them with tributes
  to the murdered students.  (8:01 PM Suspicious Juveniles) Deputy Bruce
  Vallerand caught a 12 year-old black kid with a gun. He says he doesn't have
  a gun, but they saw him throw it. He's in 7th grade. They ask him his
  homeroom teacher's name, but he doesn't know since he just got there. They
  ask his old homeroom teacher's name and he doesn't know that either. They
  find cocaine in a wrapped up paper. That way they can drop it and no one will
  know. They are $20 rocks.  They saw him toss the gun into the bushes when he
  pulled up. There are three kids getting into guns and drugs and gangs already
  -- two lives lost.

**Los Angeles CA 12**

- (11:20 AM Saturday) LA County Sheriff's Department Homicide Investigation --
  George calls the police to say his wife is lying on the floor it looks like
  someone broke into his house and stabbed her. He didn't check the body to see
  if she's breathing. The dispatcher tells him to check.  She's dead in a large
  pool of blood. He called into Lakewood Station at 8:33am, said he woke up and
  found her. Lt. Joe Brown investigates, talks on the phone and has a theory
  about it. They check the closets and the fridge, but there is no alcohol in
  the house. They talk to the neighbor. He's known them for years, they have no
  problems and he saw them a few days ago to pay the rent. He has no idea why
  someone would want to kill her. They check the stab wound and see it was a
  large wound that must've been 12 inch knife. They roll her over and to take
  pictures. They load the body up and the blood is leaking through the sheets.
  They find the murder weapon and there is nothing stolen, nothing ransacked.
  The husband was home when they got there. They are going to talk to the
  husband and stepson at the station. (2:38 PM Homicide Bureau) They ask George
  his story. He usually sleeps late, but he woke up early. She was already up,
  so he decided to get up. He's slow to get dressed and took five minutes. He
  opened up the door and she was lying there in a pool of blood. They say there
  is a problem, something happened this morning. They all know he murdered his
  wife and he can't face up to the fact that he did it. Something happened to
  make him mad. How did the blood get on the top of his shoes? He says he
  doesn't know what it was, it was there for days. He thought it was her paint
  or Crayolas.
- (4:46 PM Homicide Bureau) They ask if he washed his hands after finding her.
  They take samples from between his fingers to see if he has blood stains. If
  it's positive it'll change to purple or pink and it won't matter if he washed
  his hands. His hands are very sweaty and he says it's from his medication.
  She continues to swab his hands. It's not a specific blood test, it's
  presumptive to allow them to investigate further. They pull out his shoes
  that have red on them as well as hair and possible brain matter. They talk to
  the stepson and ask if George is capable of harming his mother. He doesn't
  know, she met him when he was 5 and he's 18 now. He's never seen him get mad,
  he raised his voice once in a great while and he's a soft mellow person. He
  wants to know if someone else besides George stabbed her. They don't know. He
  wants to know where she is. They say at the coroner's office. (1:10 PM
  Tuesday) Crime Lab -- It turns out she wasn't stabbed, she was shot in the
  back of the head and it shattered. They want the shoe analyzed for brain
  matter. He told them that he approached he wife from behind between her legs
  and touched her from the back, but the pool of blood was by her head. She
  analyzes the Reebok tennis shoe in a lab. There was no exit wound. She puts
  the shoe on a microscope and they wonder about the power. She says the red is
  clear like strawberry jam, certainly not blood.  His story is going to stand,
  maybe she let someone in. They'll have to get prints from the knife, maybe
  she stabbed the suspect and he stabbed her. She brought a knife to a
  gunfight. (2:30 PM Friday) There are no prints on the knife and no motive for
  the husband. It could've been a rapist or an opportunist. George says when he
  went to call 911 the phone was unplugged. He had to plug it back in. It's
  always plugged in because he has a recorder for the rental properties he
  owns. Maybe someone got in with a phone company uniform.
- Temple City Sheriff's Station (911 Call Assault with a Deadly Weapon) A woman
  calls about an attack from a man in a green Jeep with a white top. He just
  got on the freeway and they go to look for it. They spot a pickup truck
  heading west with a bunch of junk in the back with a tarp over it. There are
  three people in the truck, one child. It's heavy traffic so they can't make a
  stop. (5:11 PM Felony Stop) They pull him over on Rosemeade Blvd. He's an
  older Mexican guy in a cowboy hat. They pull him out at gunpoint and tell him
  it's not a joke. Then they call the younger Mexican guy out and tell him to
  put his hands out the window, but he doesn't listen. The white male passenger
  tries to get out to, and they yell at him to get back in. He finally gets out
  and is filthy. The suspect is Jessie Barber wanted in the murder of George's
  wife, but this guy's not the one. Deputy Patrick Martinez says to cut them
  loose and explain what happened. Deputy Ann Brannon has to explain. There was
  a serious crime down the street that matched the description. He thought he
  was the one blasting the radio in front of him.  They just did an excavation
  site and scared the crap out of them. They let them go.

**Minneapolis, MN 1**

- (3:35 PM Officer Assistance Call) A code 3 call comes in.  Sgt. Larry Wilens
  responds to it on 46th street. The suspect is barricaded.  Officers tried to
  serve a warrant to 63 year-old Kenneth Lynn and he shot at police twice
  through the door, but missed them.
- (Tactical Team Briefing) Deputy Chief Doug Smith says they asked Ken to come
  out to talk to him for neighborhood problems -- smell and trash. They are
  trying to make contact with him and find out from neighbors if anyone else
  lives there since he could have hostages. The teams face is covered, they are
  inside perimeter, they can use gas on him if necessary. If he has a long
  rifle he can get them. They have to stay back and use high risk entry
  tactics. The team has to survey the house, will be close enough where he
  could hit them with a rock.
- (Negotiation Team Command Post) Neighbors stated he suffered a head trauma
  injury in WWII, but has never been to the hospital for mental illness, he has
  very poor eyesight, cataracts, heavy smoker, emphysema, bronchitis, hasn't
  drank for 13 years, but if he's drinking again he'll be very hostile and,
  negative. He just was in detox 2 weeks ago -- a good sign he's been drinking
  again. His personal info is on the board "DOB 8/20/27 or 29, divorced,
  ex-wife Mildred (lives with Gail) alcoholic who gets hostile when he drinks,
  has 4 children." One cop knows him, didn't know he was a problem. Sgt.
  Charles Resch says he's a loner, has 3 or 4 old cars, his mom died 8 years
  ago, he's kind of weird. The cop who was shot at says it went right between
  them, splinters of the door hit him. Officer Rick Stanek says he has a 300
  rifle, 3-4 shotguns with ammo, a German Luger, 38 & 45 revolver and a 25
  automatic according to his son. Two weeks ago he called in for a report and
  they took him to detox instead of taking a report so he's mad at the cops.
  They get a call of an attic. Cops back up with blast shield, they run behind
  a car, stay low. They hide behind a car, want to get close to shoot gas and
  others wait next door at 4800. They want to negotiate, get him on the phone,
  if he won't answer they'll throw in a phone. Anything to talk him out, gas is
  the last chance, no turning back then. Sgt. Robert Gretton explains about the
  phone they are throwing in that will go back to the team directly to
  negotiate with them. The team goes up heavily armed with a shield, one
  smashes the window with a crowbar and the next tosses the phone in a bag.
  They call at 4:44 PM that it is in. They beep it from the station and Larry
  calls for him to pick up. Outside they call in to pick up the phone. Larry
  wants to help, tells him open it up and pick it up. He picks up. He doesn't
  blame him, they are both sick of listening to the beeper, what's going on? He
  can hear him. Then he hangs up.
- (6:25 PM) He said he's sick of the beeping and cut the line. Officer Dave
  Mattson is outside in camo gear. They want cold beers, fresh women and a
  pizza. Larry calls again. Sgt. John Hennessy says to be very authoritative,
  this is what they want him to do, no more playing around, for his own good.
- (8:08 PM) Larry tells him he has to talk to him. Ken says he had to tend to
  his dog's foot and put peroxide on it. What's all the yelling about? They
  want to talk to him. He says they like to hear themselves talk it's so loud.
  Larry says it's been an hour and half since he talked to him. People are
  going to react to him. What is it going to take to get him out? He wants
  Cordell and Ruben Johnson. He says Cordell is there. He says he's not. That's
  what they tell him, he can't come on though. He won't trust a cop, it's like
  trusting Dillinger.  Larry says if he puts Cordell on will he come out. He
  might. If he does something for Ken he has to so something for him. The team
  outside creeps around to get drinks and come back, knees are killing them and
  they are thirsty. They cut his power. He doesn't give a crap, doesn't need
  it. He needs him to come out, he has people lined up. Are you afraid of
  getting hurt? He's seen those trigger happy sons of bitches in action. Larry
  says with all the people and the press around they aren't going to get
  trigger happy. He has to help him though. He promises if he comes out he'll
  secure the house and take the keys to his sister. He says he'll consider
  coming out if he can bring his dog with him. He can't do that. He'll turn him
  over to his son Dustin though and leave him in the basement. Sgt. Robert
  Skmora listens. Larry says to put him down and come back. He says for
  tactical to get set up. It's dark now.
- (9:39 PM) The plan is for him to come out. He wants to go to the VA. He was
  in 20 years ago for violence. He wants to see the SOB he talked to last time.
  Is he still there? He saw his name on the list. He wants to tell him how full
  of crap he is. If he tells him he'll take him to the VA and they won't accept
  him then what? That's a different story, he doesn't know, he won't have any
  power then. They'll talk to the people later. He wants them to talk now,
  later is crap. What else will it take to get him out? They worry about what
  they'll do with him in the future. Dr. Steve Geiger, Psychological Consultant
  says they have to worry about that, can't lie to him. He'll say I listened to
  him once, he won't again. He has access to lots of weaponry and will in the
  future. When he comes out they'll place him under arrest and clear the house.
  Ken asks what does he want him to do. He wants him to walk out with his hands
  up, stand on the steps and listen to the officers for what to do. They call
  the tactical team that he is ready. He comes out in a dirty blue street and
  hat. They tell him to walk to them and turn around, down on his knees, keeps
  hands up, then lay on his stomach. Two guys go over and cuff him. They are
  worried about other people inside, but he says there is no one. They take him
  to the car. He says again he's alone. Officer Riley Gilchrist comes over to
  Larry and shakes his hand and hugs him, good work. Ken got pissed that they
  were yelling at him outside and he came to the phone. Inside they show the
  two bullet holes in the door. There is a 30-30 on the couch. He had a gas
  mask next to him, he was prepared. He has a semi automatic, lots of riles and
  ammo there. It would've been a hell of a battle. The place is a mess and
  there are pill bottles all over the tables. Chief John Laux arrives and tells
  them it's recorded for posterity and will show they take a backseat to
  nobody, they are the best they proved it again tonight, nice job. The suspect
  was charges with second degree assault and released on bail the following
  day.

- (Police Academy Survival Training Exercise) Cadet Mike Looney says to get out
  of the car with his hands in the air. He wanted to be a cop since he was a
  kid, maybe he's na√Øve, but the fact you can help people is a noble position
  to be in. Officer Wes Edstrom supervises as he gets out of the car at
  gunpoint, cuffs and searches a guy. Mike is told to keep the back door open
  while searching them and put their feet back and head on the trunk to keep
  them off balance. When you go down to search don't go on your knees or they
  can kick you. It's looks good. (Practical Exercises Lab) Sgt.  Dave Martenz
  draws on a board about the training, they can film them from all angles. They
  can see if they have it or not, how they treat people, if they have a bad
  attitude. He's not looking to scare them or drum them out, he wants it to be
  a positive experience. They are going to a bar scenario. The actors are real
  cops using lines they've all heard in the bars. Dave says he's heard it over
  12 years while he watching, it's real interesting. The bartender says he's
  having trouble with drunk customers and wants them out. They try to talk to
  them and say why do they have to leave. It's their bar, they want them out.
  One woman fights and they throw them out. Then they find a gun on one guy and
  he claims he has a permit and wants to show it. He tries to get him to put
  the gun down as his partner holds him at gunpoint. They hold him back and he
  fights because he doesn't like to be restrained. He says he can walk out on
  his own.  They say OK and the guy runs out. He comes back in with a gun and
  says for the cops to let her go or they'll get shot. They both run out.
  That's two in a row they screwed up. Dave says if they can't win don't go
  forward. (Cadet Graduation) They have to swear in and are official housing
  patrol cops in a large ceremony. Mike kisses his gum-chewing wife.
- (Roll Call) Sgt. Thomas Kerns reads out the assignment. 510 is Laplant and
  Zurwas, 520 is Hirsch and Looney.  Mike was top man in his class and got the
  William Perry award -- they are goofing on him. Talk to the Sgt about it.
  (8:40 PM) Officer Mike Looney says it's his first day. (911 Call Street
  Shooting) A black man in blue jeans, a blue hat with A on it and a black
  t-shirt is the shooter. Greg is driving him on his first day. Tom says she's
  all yours. They drive around looking for the guy and finally spot him. Mike
  holds him at gunpoint, Greg searches him and says he's sweating like a
  racehorse. The suspect asks what that means. He's cuffed and says he matches
  the description of a shooter. Where was he? He was at his girlfriend's,
  cousin's house. He turned away because he's scared out the police, not going
  to lie. His cousin lives right there at 206. They go back to the cordoned off
  scene to ID him. Officer Greg Hirsch says the hat is a Wrigley field diamond
  which looks like an A (9:10 PM) The ambulance is working on the victim with
  two gun shots in him. A witness with long dreadlocks says he saw him when he
  was sitting in front of his house and ID's him. It was a shooting at a crack
  house. The suspect was chasing the victim in his car, he hit an innocent car,
  crashed into a tree and the guy jumped out and shot him three times. He has a
  bunch of rock on him, might be a drug deal gone bad. The shooter gives him
  three different stories -- he was watching TV with his girlfriend, then can't
  remember the show, then wasn't watching TV. (10:31 PM) The suspect is brought
  in. Mike says for the first day it feels good, after the years of college and
  school, now it starts to pay off. On the first day you want to catch all the
  bad guys.
- (4:35 PM Assistance Call) He says all rookies get in a mind set like they are
  going to change the world. One cop told him you aren't going to change the
  world, just go out and make your little dent. After 20 years there will be
  someone behind you to do the same thing. A call of a confused elderly lady at
  a downtown store comes in. The woman says she missed the bus and was short on
  taxi fare. She's a government worker, on SSI and gets a check every third
  work. She's well known and called the police for a ride because she was
  always told to call a cop when she was in trouble. So they give her a ride.
  (5:20 PM) She says she works and is a good woman who earns a living. (9:21 PM
  911 Call Assault in Progress) They spot a Mike, black guy in a yellow hat
  with his shirt falling off and put him in the car. The victim has a thick
  Russian accident. He says the guy attacked his friend, came up to him, was on
  drugs and took his watch. His friend comes up with a shirt wrapped around his
  head, his face is bruised, bloody and he needs stitches. He hit him with his
  fists and they ran to the gas station and found a pipe to defend themselves.
  Mike says those two guys attacked him and ripped his jacket, he doesn't know
  why and he hasn't been drinking. Officer Larry Krebsbach puts him in the
  ambulance. Officer Laurie Janikowski finds a watch in Mike's pocket and asks
  the victim to describe it. He says it's a cheap gold Rolex and it's broken,
  because he broke it. It's a match. (10:08 PM) Out there you are dealing with

**Minneapolis, MN 3 -- Women Cops**

- (8:13 PM Domestic Disturbance) Third Precinct -- Officer Janee Harteau says
  the main reason she became a cop because it was challenging, not a controlled
  environment, you deal with all kinds of people from all races and all levels
  of poverty from rich to poor. It's different, but everyone's the same. It's
  easier to talk to people when you are a female. They were brought up to talk
  first, physical next. Officer Holly Keegel has a blonde short puffy mullet
  and says originally was going to be a teacher, but took some law courses and
  really enjoyed it. She took more classes and decided to pursue law. They go
  into a backyard and there is a dirty white guy with a heavily stained shirt
  sitting there. He says he lives there, looks drunk and has trouble standing
  up They lead him around front to search him, find nothing, put him in the car
  and he flips out. He curses at them and says he didn't break any law and
  won't fully get in. The woman in the house says he's her brother. He's an
  alcoholic, one of the nicest guys when sober, but when drinking you stay away
  from him. They go back to him and he says "take it easy, I don't care who you
  are, what are you trying to do, why don't you stop?" They want him out so
  they can cuff him. He struggles, goes down, his shirt comes up and he tries
  to roll away when they go to cuff him. Holly puts her knee on his head. He
  curses them and says something about them failing training. Janee says it
  doesn't matter that they are women, they aren't messing around. They aren't
  getting away with it.
- On their off time we see Janee playing the drums with black gloves while
  Holly plays the keyboards in the garage. Holly took piano lessons for a
  little while, but gave it up to play sports. She can't read music, but plays
  by ear. She wears short pink shorts and a Guess top. Janee sings, she was in
  a band, so they got together and thinks they can really do good some day if
  they pursue it. It's a great stress reliever away from the job. (10:03 PM
  Theft in Progress) A young black kid was seen running. They pull up and Holly
  runs out and catches him. She stands on him and cuffs him. He was on a
  motorcycle and she brings him to the backup unit and puts him in the car. She
  goes back to the Vespa scooter. Sgt. Tom O'Rourke arrives as their car is
  making all kinds of noise. Holly explains the screw is off on the air
  conditioner. There were four of them, but they only caught him.  He's a
  juvenile and will be booked for theft. A full jail is a happy jail.
- (3:21 AM) 911 Call Residential Robbery -- Officer Pam Elius says it's quite a
  job, not anyone can do it, no other job is like it. She couldn't do anything
  else and wouldn't want to do anything else. Where else could you work 8 hours
  a day and have fun? A black man fled a house he robbed with a gun. They go to
  the house and the victim is an old woman who is terrified. She was sleeping
  and the guy came into her room and covered her mouth, she's worried her mouth
  is swollen. Officer Charles Teneyck writes her story down. Pam gets her
  water. Her mouth is fat and she tastes blood. He went through her purse, took
  her keys, told her he needs money because his kids were hungry. She went to
  get her purse and wouldn't turn the light on, but was afraid he would attack
  her. He came in the back window, but she only had $1 in there. She didn't
  hear him, he left out the back door and gave her the keys back. Pam checks
  the window and the screen is cut. She hopes with the info she gave them and
  the jewelry he stole they can track down the piece of scum. (4:47 AM Vehicle
  Fire) They go to a yellow van that is burning up as fire and black smoke are
  pouring out of it. They find a guy nearby and check him out. She moves the
  car away in case it blows up. She gets out to talk about blocking traffic and
  there is an explosion. The Fire Department arrives. Pam hopes there was no
  one inside, she called but got no answer. The guy says he and his girlfriend
  live in the van and are homeless, she lit a cigarette and he couldn't get her
  out. They don't find a body though.  The guy has Tylenol 3 that he says it's
  for his leg. He talks slow and he's out of it. He has chest pains. There's no
  label on it the pills because he wanted to sell them. Pam says there was no
  girl there, but he says she was. He wants his pills back, she says to talk to
  the doctor. He wants to take a leak, she says only if he wants to go to jail.

  would go around the corner, he's someone they know and trust, a friend of her
  aunt and he's 35-40. He told them to get in the car so she got in the back
  and he told her to come up front. They went to McDonald's ordered food and he
  didn't pay for it. He told her to come in his car and sit up there, she said
  no, she was going to go to McDonald's and he said no, but they went anyway.
  He wanted to go to the movies, she said they couldn't do that and he started
  the car, she wanted to go home, he parked and asked her to show him
  something. She says she didn't have anything. Then he said he would show her
  something. She said no. Did she know what he was talking about? Yeah, his
  private parts. He started driving, almost crashed and she yelled. He put his
  hand on her leg and she started crying. He said you are scared huh? Macy and
  her mom then cry. It will be molestation and they will turn over to child
  welfare. They will get back to her, they take it very serious. Avoid contact
  with Freddy, they'll get back to them, it could be something he does often.
  She did the right thing by telling her mom, she was very brave, a lot of
  people don't tell, otherwise it could go on. Stay away from him, it's a bad
  scene.
- (Roll Call) Fifth Precinct -- Officer Don Bautista says they had an unusual
  burglary last night, all he did was go through the woman's underwear, sexual
  in nature. She is a counselor from St. Mary's chemical dependencies.  He was
  discharged on Monday, has called and left her a message on her machine. He
  works at a Pizzeria, is a 20 year old white male, they'll talk to him tonight
  and see what his story is. All he did was take her underwear out and did what
  those type of people do. (7:45 PM Burglary Investigation) They go to Ribizza
  looking for Ben, he isn't there, but will be back in 15 minutes. He's wearing
  a white t-shirt and dark shorts. They get him when he pulls up and detain
  him.  He's curious as to what is going on. There was a burglary on 27th &
  Xerxes last night while he was working to someone he's familiar with. He says
  Tracy is the only one she knows living there. He has surprised her when she
  was sunbathing at home and on the beach. He says he said hello to her at the
  beach and she was expecting him at the house. He's been in her house before
  with her, with her permission. It's just an interview, so he's let go. He
  goes to see Tracy. She says she didn't call Ben and didn't make a date with
  him. He tells her what Ben said that she made advances towards him. He knows
  this is false. There is no relationship between them. She says "oh, god"
  about her dating him, he must have quite a record. He says he has no record
  and checked around the world. She asks if he thinks Ben will do something. He
  can't guarantee that. When she comes home, open the door, don't go in, wait,
  listen. Don't go anywhere alone, bring people with you. The guy is a wacko,
  you've read the papers. They have probable cause to arrest him and goes back
  to Ribizza to look for him. He goes in and finds him in the back. He is
  searched, cuffed, taken downtown and mirandized.
- (7:17 PM Domestic Violence Call) Third Precinct -- Officer John Billington
  says it seems whenever you get alcohol and drugs in the picture it gets
  worse. Lots more domestics lately, whenever force is used on people living
  together they have to make an arrest. Officer Steve Setzer is his partner.
  They get a call from a woman saying her husband is smoking crack in the house
  and she wants him out. They pull up, she says he's in the bathroom freaking
  out and has kids inside and a gun. They don't want to go in and say she
  should get an order of protection against him. They go in eventually slowly
  with guns drawn and head upstairs.  They find Quinn up there, but he goes
  down the hall on him.  He says he didn't put his hands on nobody, hasn't done
  anything. They go to cuff him and he says don't take me please. They are just
  talking to him. There are two infants laying on the bed. He says when he got
  back they really started arguing. He's breathing heavy, says he's hot, really
  scared and not on crack.  John changes a diaper on a crying baby. The woman
  says he spent the whole rent check on crack, he was swinging things around,
  she was really scared and he was foaming at the mouth. They tried to keep him
  inside until the ambulance came, but he was slinging them around.  Quinn is
  sweating bullets, says he didn't mean nobody harm, didn't hurt anyone. She
  says he needs help.  She went to Chicago with her mom, came back and he sold
  everything. All of her furniture was gone, he sold it. They can't find any
  drugs, so will take him for domestic. He promises not to do anything and will
  leave. He says she can get a restraining order on him, just don't arrest him.
  They tell her to go to the county, floor 17 and file a OOP on him. He just
  wanted to take his car and leave. She says he went out to get pot, he came
  back, went into the bathroom and she smelled smoke. He came out, threw her
  and his sister around.  It appeared like he was smoking crack. The sad part
  was he checked the diapers not to see if they were wet, but to see if he
  shoved the crack in there, he's seen it before. A cop can't expect he can
  change the world, but he can make it a little better.

- (2:15 PM Riot Control Briefing) Deputy Chief Doug Smith says the Skinheads,
  Lawyers Guild and Woman against Military Madness will be in the demonstration
  at 3:30 PM by the federal building. Expect 300-500 people.  They don't have a
  parade permit, won't disclose it so they'll go in private to discourage and
  provoke the police. They will provoke by spray painting things.  If cops move
  in they will throw rocks at them. They will ID the leaders and may wait until
  the end before they arrest people. A female cop goes undercover as a punk
  goth chick in a black wig with black lipstick. The cops get all their riot
  gear ready. A speaker says they have no permit, but will march anyway. A
  hippy leader approaches police who will assist them in any way possible. They
  will give a police escort, but keep the traffic blockage to a minimum and no
  vandalism. The guy says they don't want any trouble, want to march, traffic
  support is OK. Their chant is "We're going to beat back the Bush attack" and
  "1234 we don't want their bloody war." They put up posters and burn a dummy.
  Then things get out of hand and one person is arrested. They tell the leader
  they have painted the building twice, vandalized, enough is enough, time to
  move along. A couple fights and are arrested. The goal was to wait and
  surgically remove the leaders. A guy threw paint bombs and two people jumped
  them, all are arrested. (5:05 PM Debriefing) The leader bit an IDS guard and
  went to jail. The plain clothes people ID'd him, a job well done.
- (911 Call Street Fight) Third District -- It's at 3309 Clinton Ave, one male
  down, one might have a gun and a bunch of people have sticks and bats. They
  pull up and stop three guys, one has a bar. Officer Steve Setzer is there. A
  black guy has a huge stick in his pocket. He says a guy broke out his car
  window and called them niggers. Officer John Billington goes to the victim.
  He's a white guy with a bunch of cuts and a bloody nose he covers. He says
  they ran through his yard, didn't see them, but knows their car. Three black
  guys tried to break into his garage, he confronted them, they beat him and
  took off. His car also has windows broken out. One of the crooks says he
  punched him in the face and pulled a knife on them and they took off. He says
  there were two of them and stabbed their windows. One guy keeps yelling and
  John tells them to speak English, he's listening, stop the garbage. The guy
  in a Batman shirt gets loud and says the guy accused him of going through his
  yard. They ran and thought they caught him. The victim says they came through
  his yard and they beat him up. The criminals says they left their house, went
  to their car, the guy yelled at them, smashed their car and they chased him,
  but didn't catch them. No one knows what happened, both are lying and they
  can't tell who is telling the truth. They are going to write them up and cut
  them loose. What about their car? That's what insurance is for.
- Fourth Precinct Roll Call -- Sgt. Frank Dallman reads a report about a young
  black thief who cuts in windows and steals things, tools and more. Officer
  Bill Thornberg has been there 15 years, likes the job since he's outside all
  day and can't stand office work. His car is his office, he's his own boss,
  other jobs aren't as flexible, the pay isn't great, but it's a good job.
  Officer Chuck Nathan is his partner. (7:48 PPM Fight Call) A man was hit in
  the face with a shovel. There is a massive group of people there when they
  arrive. The victim is on a lawn and is bloody and squirming. A woman and her
  children are screaming and crying all around. Bill says to move back, give
  him air, it's hot as hell. The victim's ear is split and he needs to stay
  down, but keeps trying to move. A crowd stands around, they don't know who he
  is, but know the guy who did it though. His name is Terry and the victim is
  George. He's bleeding from his arm and ear. EMS arrives, says he's
  unconscious, they need to move him fast and holds his head. It's a struggle
  to move him. A witness says Terry broke a beer bottle and hit him. He pulled
  out a bunch of his hair, then they started punching and fighting. He was
  stabbed 4-5 times with bottle, split ear, cut artery in neck, spurting blood.
  It wasn't a shovel.  They caught Terry a few blocks away. George's mother
  holds a bloody rag and throws it at the suspect. She says, "You hurt my boy,
  he loved you all this time. He is Indian, American."

- (3:13 PM Woman with a Gun Call) Officer Greg Hirsch says it's an interesting
  job, he works with 800 people where if he has a problem with 1 or 2 of them,
  that goes out the window when you go to back them up.  He'll put his life
  down for those 800 people even if he's never met them before. He gets a call
  of a white woman with a gun at 2919 in the rear in a yellow shirt. They get
  out and run through a parking lot with guns drawn. There is a group of people
  in the lot and they tell the woman in yellow to get her hands up and she
  doesn't listen so someone pushes her forward. She says she doesn't have a
  gun, she did, but dropped it behind the car. They find an automatic handgun
  back there with no clip. A witness says she's been pointing the gun around
  for two hours. The cops came once and she said it was just a fight and they
  left and she started it again. Greg loves this job, where else can you go the
  wrong way doing 60mph on a one-way street. (7:05 PM Neighbor Dispute) A woman
  brings her kid over who says his brother's shirt was thrown on the neighbor's
  roof and he wanted to get it and the guy told him if he went up there he'd
  shoot him. She doesn't really know the neighbor. The neighbor says he's had a
  lot of problems with these kids. They take his stuff and damage his property.
  He found a kid on his roof, didn't know who was up there and they wouldn't
  come down so he told them if they didn't come down he said he would go get
  his gun. He admits it was the heat of the moment, a dumb thing to say, but he
  was tired because he had a really bad day and took it out on the kids. Greg
  says she can follow a criminal complaint on him and goes back and has the guy
  apologize so it doesn't have to go any further. It's better they try to get
  along, but next time ask the guy before you climb on his garage.
- (911 Call Domestic Violence) Officer Bill Thornberg says with domestics you
  never know what to expect when you get there. The tradition is a man
  threatening or hitting a woman and he goes off to jail, but you never know.
  Andrea Jones calls that her boyfriend went off on her, he's on cocaine, she
  can't control him and she cries. It is nighttime at house 1530. They walk up
  and hear gunfire in the distance. The guy inside says he's drunk again. She
  says he threatened to kill her and 911 heard it. He says it's just a threat
  thing, he does it all the time, but she denies it. He just came home, accused
  her of crazy things and threw her down. Police have been there before and she
  never pressed charges because she loved him. She wants him out, wants him
  arrested and wants to press charges. All her family is dead except for her
  sister upstairs and she couldn't get a hold of her. She said she didn't do
  anything.  Officer Chuck Nathan checks him for weapons. She says he's been on
  coke for months and called her a slut.  She was at her sisters, not at bars,
  found out he was on coke two weeks ago and called the crisis line, but they
  don't understand. Bill says no, he hasn't been out there before and gives her
  a card with victims rights and domestic violence info, how to get a
  restraining order and the number for a battered women's shelter. She says
  it's her home and if she leaves he'll follow her. They tell her to leave the
  phone off the hook. She doesn't want them to let him out tonight. Bill says
  they'll call before they let him out. She says to ask his mom how abusive he
  is, but only to her.
- (12:40 AM Neighbor Dispute) Third Precinct -- Officer Steve Setzer says the
  call is for neighbor trouble, one threatening another. It's pitch black when
  they walk up to the house and a guy says they are in the back fighting. They
  walk around and can hear a woman yelling. She said she heard the woman
  neighbor saying, "I hate those niggers and niggers this." The second woman
  says they cut her power and has to have all the smoke detectors wired
  together. She's white and was in her house having a private conversation. The
  black lady says she could hear it in her kitchen. Officer Cheri Dexter talks
  to her, she says she has two witnesses. Cheri says there is nothing they can
  do, how are they going to get along, it's between them and the landlord. A
  black guy with no shirt appears and says they threw beer at them. She says
  they threatened to blow up her house. Steve says for them all to go to bed
  and ignore each other. She says she pays $48 a month and it's a nice place.
  The white guy is drunk and told the black guy, "... for the niggers to get
  out of here." They go back around and tell them to cut the crap and stop
  yelling. The white guy says he told him he would get his gun and blow his
  brains out, is that right?  Cheri says other neighbors are complaining too.
  She can't stay there all night, give it up tonight. Steve says it starts to
  seem like they are the problem, the guy is a drunk and obnoxious. The guy
  says he hasn't bothered anyone. He says maybe he will go to bed, maybe he
  won't. How dare he call me a drunk, how do to you know me, you're so tough?
  Steve says to come on out of his house. He makes noises at him and says he
  won't come out because then you'll arrest me.  Steve says he's an obnoxious
  jerk, but there is no law allowing them to pull him out of his house and
  taking him to detox.

- (Alaska State Troopers) Nome -- Trooper Ike Lorentz & Sgt. Al Schadle check
  the weather, 1000 foot overcast, visibility 15 miles. They are going 180
  miles away, should take an hour. There was an assault and more a couple days
  ago. They look at the map and go out to top off the gas tank on their small
  plane. The state is 560,000 square miles, as big as the US. He'll work a 16
  hour day and 10 of it is in the air. His beat is 200,000 square miles, if
  it's not the last frontier nothing is. (Village of Savoonga) There is a
  bootlegging operation where they make or can buy the alcohol and transport it
  to a dry village. This causes problems for at least a week until it dries up.
  Magistrate Abner Golorgergen meets them at the tiny airport. They ride in a
  truck to the magistrate's office. Once there they talk to an Eskimo who seems
  high and usually isn't like that. There is a makeshift court in the building
  and they try the Eskimo man. He shot a rifle outside of a public building and
  was drunk in the second judicial district. The highest penalty is $5,000 and
  a year in jail. Ike says the man is a danger by the state of his mind and
  asks that bail be set in the matter. It is set at $1000. Abner wears
  sunglasses and jeans and as soon as he's done he takes the robe off. They
  have to take the man's possessions, but he doesn't want them to. He wants to
  take them home. He says they have to do it and he is in their possession
  until they get him back to Nome. He wanted help, turned himself in and wanted
  to get out of the village. They take him out to the airport, get on the plane
  and fly back.
- (Hit & Run Investigation) Anchorage PD -- Officer Mark Hunstiger says people
  joke about the town. The nice thing about it is you can get to Alaska from
  there. There are 250,000 people living there, half the state. An island city
  stuck in a vast wilderness. They've had five hit & runs in the last 10
  minutes by a man in an Arizona van. He spots the red van in a parking lot
  with a brown car under the back end. The guy ran off and witnesses point him
  across the street. The guy is behind a building where a woman is keeping her
  eye on him. He searches him and asks if he had any beers. He says three. Mark
  asks him if he had them all at the same time and he says yes. He admits he
  only backed over one car because he didn't see it. He didn't hit anyone else.
  His DOB is 2/31/59. Mark talks to witnesses and suddenly the drunk has left
  his car. He asks if this an escape and has to go back in the car. He says he
  will behave if he removes the cuffs.  Mark says they don't make deals with
  drunks. They go to put him back and he fights. Two women help and they have
  to hobble him. He says to go ahead and arrest him. They agree. They take him
  back to the station and his BAC is .232.  He says the Fiat parked behind him,
  it wasn't his fault. He skimmed off a car at a bar. Which one? The bar where
  they found him. He wasn't at a bar, he was at a credit union. He was? Mark
  says maybe they serve drinks there. The magistrate can't believe the damage
  he caused and since the guy only has $50 on him he won't make bail which is
  good because he's so dangerous. He can't believe no one got killed in his
  rampage.
- (State Troopers) Pilot Bob Larson is going to Seward to recover a body from a
  plane crash that happened three weeks ago. It is at the 3000 foot level in
  the mountains. The wreckage broke up bad the first time they were there when
  they found four bodies. The site is often in the clouds and they've been
  there four times already. Cpl. Jerry Fleetwood is coordinating the search.
  Hopefully he'll recover the body and the effects, ID it by whatever means,
  then notify the next of kin and get the remains back to them.  A Cessna 207
  during an hour flight tour that took people from a cruise ship hit the side
  of a mountain. They are supposed to meet climbers there. They land the
  helicopter on a mountain and walk over. Two male climbers are heading down
  tot he wreckage. Jerry says the best thing about being a trooper is the
  gratification from getting the job done. The only good thing there will be is
  to bring the remains back to the family. They find the body, load it up in a
  bag, move the helicopter and lower a tow rope down to get it. The father of
  the dead girl was waiting for her, but had to go back to Florida for medical
  reasons. Back at the base Jerry calls the father and says the body is at the
  funeral home where is wife is. He hopes that returning her will put it to
  rest in his mind.

  Asberry and Sgt. Dan Hickman got a call last night that three male youths
  were joyriding in a boat, took a sharp turn and the two in the back fell out.
  The driver came back and found one guy, but not the other. It'll take an hour
  to get there by plane, about 100 miles away. They wheel out a Cessna tri
  wheel from a hanger. They says the area looks smooth, but there is a lot of
  turmoil under the water, lots of eddies and drownings. Kotlik -- they see
  nothing from the air. At the airport they meet Safety Officer William Murphy.
  He says they just gassed up and they've been using poles to drag both side of
  the river.  They get a call that they found the victim and go to the wooden
  jail for a body bag. They drive a boat out and there are another 10 boats on
  the scene near where it happened. They have a foot sticking out of a line.
  They get into a second boat and spread out the body bag and pull the body in.
  They go to the magistrate to say the kid had no life vest on, if he did he
  probably would've lived.
- (4:58 PM Child Assault Call) Anchorage -- Officer Marc Woodward says Alaska
  is a very liberal state. The people's rights are utmost so they have to be
  extra sharp with constitutional laws so they don't lose a case because of it.
  A teenager assaulted a small child and EMS is on the scene. They are in a
  field and the kid is screaming. His friend Brian who is 21 says he fed the
  kid alcohol because he wanted it. EMS needs to take him to the hospital, the
  kid says he had a couple of Coronas. He lives on Jewel Lake and has no phone.
  A witness says he saw the kid crawling away and the Brian picked him up and
  threw him, then tried to carry him away. He grabbed him and made him put the
  kid down. They drive Brian to talk to the parents. The kid says he made them
  drink.  Brian says he wanted it. He drank some and didn't want anymore and
  they said to take it. Marc goes in to talk to the parents. Mom wants to kill
  Brian and Marc says he might himself. They do have a phone and call
  Providence Hospital. In the hospital the kid screams like crazy when they put
  a line in his throat with an IV in. His BAC is .178, would be 7-8 drinks for
  an adult, less for the kid.  They won't charge Brian until they know more.
  They give him a citation instead of going to jail, but he'll have to go to
  court. The kid seems like a zombie.  Marc says the kid could've died and
  Brian is stupid. Anytime a kid is in danger it hits closer to home,
  especially when you are a parent like he is.
- (9:20 PM Shoplifting Call) Anchorage -- Officer Scott Jessen says he's
  originally from Boise ID and the army sent him up there in January 1979. He
  likes the country, it's familiar. It's the same as Boise except for the snow
  and ice. They get a month of decent weather and the rest is snow. A kid stole
  a $14 book from a comic store. He tells the kid he is under arrest and asks
  why is he grinning at him. He says his dad's here. Scott says it's not a joke
  and he can take him to jail even if it's a comic. He says he's never been
  arrested and never stole before. He then says he didn't steal it. He put it
  in his bag while he was still shopping. Scott tells him it's concealment. He
  tells him to sit and he starts crying. The dad says he's never done it before
  and had enough cash to buy it. There is a TMNT poster on the back door where
  he's sitting. There is an Archie Comics rack with Super Mario Brothers.
  Batman and Metallica Harvester of Sorrow shirts are hanging up. He says he
  was looking at a computer game and wanted to get some other stuff. His dad
  will take him and he has to go to juvenile court. The next time he will take
  him to jail, not to his dad. There is concealment and removal, he has to
  explain to his dad the difference, but both are a crime. The kid has a swatch
  watch with a swatch guard too. After Scott says he really didn't get through
  to the kid until he realized he could go to jail. He finally figured it out
  when he started crying, that's when you know you've made the point. Over the
  credits is footage with the body bag from the first segment.

  lives. There are two guys sitting at the kitchen table under a huge American
  flag. There's a shirtless bearded man climbing out the window and Jack pulls
  his gun and says give me a reason. He comes back in and Jack asks him if he's
  Phil. He says no, he's sleeping. They pull back the covers and Phil is in bed
  in his underwear. He doesn't want to get up, wants to know what's wrong so
  Jack jumps him and puts his knee on his back and cuffs him. He pulls him up
  and the man says easy. Officer Peter Rubini talks to John Christian. They
  don't know what's going on. He says Kelly was raped. She's been there for two
  days and was passed out in the bed stark naked. The old guy went in there and
  laid down, they had a party, but he didn't rape her. He didn't do anything
  wrong, then she got up screaming. They take him out and say the problem is
  when they go to the jury it becomes a moral question instead of a legal
  question. Did he force himself on her? The evidence shows him that he did.
- Laughlin, NV (5:40 PM Child Neglect Complaint) Substation -- Officer John
  Sias goes out to his truck and says it is a boomtown. When he arrived 6 years
  ago there were only 92 people living there, now there are 4500. On New Year's
  Eve they had 70,000 people there. Their problem is having a lot of
  transients.  It's known as a boomtown so it draws a lot of people. He's going
  to check on kids living in a trailer in unsanitary conditions. He goes into a
  casino and asks for Jimbo or Jenny. They aren't sure if they are working. The
  kids are living in a trailer in the parking lot. The manager tried to look
  inside, but there's a big dog tied to it. He drives them to the lot and
  there's tons of trailers. He talks to the guy inside about the complaint and
  asks if there's anyone else there, he's not the father. John looks around,
  says it's not safe and is unsanitary. He has to take them to Child Haven. He
  tells the girl he's taking her there, it's a nice place with toys, she'll
  have to stay two days and be out Monday. Do you have a special toy you want
  to bring? Yes, what about your brother Cordell? Can you explain it to him?
  You are being a big girl, I need your help. He thanks the guy and he says to
  go before he's not so cooperative. John says he better remain that way. The
  manager says he wants them out of there by tomorrow. They find out Bobbie,
  the mother, works in the casino as a dealer and they go to talk to her. She
  says she's fine.  John explains what happened and all she says is really,
  someone complained?  He says it's a mess, no fridge, no food, the bathroom
  stank and didn't work plus the children weren't clean. She says they hadn't
  had a bath today. He's taking the kids, they'll be in the kids care, not the
  detention side.  Something has to be done. She'll send them to her mom's
  house in California.  She isn't concerned at all. He understands she's
  working on it, but he can't leave them there.
- Las Vegas (6:33 PM Strong Arm Robbery) Northeast Area Command -- Officer
  Joseph Lombardo says downtown has a variety of everything from street
  pushers, whores, transients, homeless and vagrants. You see them on TV and
  feel sorry for them, but an old guy is taking purses from old ladies,
  knocking them down, hurting them. He gives chase after a man was yelling for
  help. He catches the guy for robbing a blind man. They know Mike, they've
  arrested him before. Mike says you love me then. He checks him and says to go
  get the guy with the cane on the corner. He's lying because he must be
  running for some reason. He cuffs him and he can barely get up. They bring
  the old man he robbed who says he took a whole lot of money from him, $6 or
  $7.  Officer Thomas Fletcher gives him the money back and asks what happened.
  He was walking on Freemont Street and Mike reached in his pocket and took his
  money.  He has polio, couldn't chase him, told him to stop and is always in
  fear of his life. He'll go to jail as long as he agrees to testify. It's a
  worse crime, a larceny if he's in fear. Mike specializes in victims, he
  watches and waits for them, preys on them. They take him to jail, before it
  was just petty and loitering, now it's a felony, he'll spend time in jail.
- (11:01 PM Communication Center) A woman takes a 911 call about a runaway car
  traveling in circles in the Mirage parking lot. They don't know where the
  driver is. They pull up and someone suggests shooting out the tires. Cops say
  no. It's an old blue car with a white hard top. People want to jump in, but
  they say to stay back. They ask for a large semi truck to block it. They talk
  to the woman owner who agrees they can break the window. Officer Dennis
  Magill runs over, whacks it with the nightstick on the passenger side and
  jumps in and stops it. The crowd cheers and he gives high fives. They say it
  was a wise decision, $50 to replace the window instead of smashing it with
  the trailer. They are all happy about it and he goes back and helps clean the
  glass out. He asks her how did it happen? It slipped out of park, she didn't
  have it all the way in, got out and left it running, it hit the trailer and
  went around in circles. He doesn't know how it happened, but nobody got hurt.

- (LSP Unit Southeast Area Command) Metropolitan PD -- Officer Jack Clark calls
  a suspect with a warrant and tells him he's from Dewercs, Mr.  Rathford won a
  27" TV set from RCA. It won't cost him anything, he just has to fill out a
  questionnaire after 30 days. They pay nothing, the company pays them. He'll
  have to fill out a 150 question form. They have 40 sets, would they like
  that? They just fill it out, put their name on the list and over the years
  they could get a VCR, stereo, etc.. Sgt. Sean Donnelly says they are doing a
  reverse, calling felons to appeal to their greed. They have a callback number
  to leave their name, number and when they are home so they don't have to
  waste time looking for them. The guy called him four times over the weekend,
  he wants the TV real bad. He has drug warrants and priors. (6:20 PM) They
  arrive at an apartment complex with a 27" RCA TV empty box and haul it over
  with two guys to make it look good. It is past a swing set where kids are
  playing. The door is open as they approach. He is anxiously waiting for them
  and Jack says they had a little misunderstanding, they are police officers
  and he is under arrest. He says what? His girl can't believe it. He knows he
  has warrants, says he has nothing on him and "oh, my god." Bad news is he
  won't get a TV, good news is he'll go to Happyland to play volleyball. They
  ask him why he didn't pay his warrants, he says he just got a new job. At
  least he knows his warrant is taken care of now. They joke how heavy the TV
  with remote is as they load the empty box in the van with him. Jack says, 'By
  the way, Dewercs is screwed backwards."
- K-9 Unit -- Officer Mike Horn and "Eich". Mike says he enjoys working with
  dogs and he enjoys police work, so it's the best of both worlds. There is
  more to it being a unit, get to chase subjects in the valley, escaped
  prisoners, makes the job more interesting.  They got to a dog training field
  with an officer in a bite suit and go through a routine of pulling a man
  down. Trainer Len Durden says the man is threatening to use lethal force. The
  guy runs away and the dog goes after him. They've been together 4 years now,
  Eich is 2 years old. They work so close together, they start to think alike,
  they live together, no one feeds or pets the dog except for him. He's his
  master and the dog would lay down his life for him. (8:30 PM Code 3 Call) A
  white female escaped on Washington and Mohave and they are called in to look
  for her. Tom points where they last saw the woman and head that way. Mike
  talks to one woman outside and the dog indicates she's behind a high wall.
  Mike tells her to come out or he'll send in the dog. She doesn't and the dog
  hops right over the 7 foot concrete wall and jumps on her as she sits under a
  tree. Mike then calls him off. She is wearing a dark green top and no skirt,
  she's in black underwear. It turns out she is a man dressed as a woman and
  his penis is hanging out. Mike rewards the dog, calls him a good boy and pets
  him. Mike says the dog senses a fear smell like a color we can see. He was
  pulling him along and knew that was the suspect.
- Bike Patrol Unit -- Sgt.  Debra Gauthier says last week they issued 104
  citations for misdemeanor traffic violations, 33 arrests, took 98 calls,
  filed 76 reports, 33 misdemeanor citations, 71 traffic citations, 91 car
  stops, 63 pedestrian stops, 14 FI's, 3 felony arrests, and 30 gross
  misdemeanor arrests.  Keep up the good work, as the holidays approach they'll
  be more purse snatchers.  Officer Rick Grande says when people are blasting
  stereos in a car they can't hear, but on a bike they can get hear. It's a
  slow patrol 10-15 mph, where a car is 35pmh, so they can see and hear things
  a car can't. A couple is sitting on a bench and they ask them for ID Laura
  says she's 27 in Body Force shirt. The guy has a mullet and a butterfly on
  him. She says she went to jail for the wrong place at the wrong time. She got
  out of jail a few months ago for being in a cocaine house. He has attempted
  burglary and burglary, he is out of state and has to register within 48 hours
  entering Nevada. The butterfly knife he has is illegal, it's a felony. He has
  a walkman on while they talk and he is under arrest. They make Laura throw
  her trash out. People walk back and hang out to see what's going on. He wants
  his girl to hold his wallet, but only has $5 inside. He wants a cigarette and
  Debra says no, he struggles about it and she gets him in a choke hold. They
  tell Laura to take off. The mullet head stops answering questions without a
  lawyer. They were sitting on top of the bench and saw the knife, he's an
  ex-felon from Florida, been there three months.

- (Clark County District Court #4) Metro PD Judge Earle W.  White, Jr. meets
  with Officer Randy Sutton in his chambers. He says the warrant is for a
  seizure of a bunch of guns. It started as a burglary of guns and drugs --
  legal steroids from Jeff. He found the guy who robbed him and took Randy to
  the suspect's house in Henderson where he had the stuff. He told him the
  story how he was put on his knees at gunpoint and interrogated. He asked him
  how he came to Jeff's house. He bought steroids from him for four months,
  he's a big guy, body builder. Randy went to Judge Levitt and got papers. He's
  a big gun aficionado. He came to the door with a glock on his hip when they
  arrested him.  He has AK-47, he went to jail, is out now, but they want to go
  back and get the rest of the guns. Earle makes him swear that what he says is
  true and he does and signs it. Randy says outside they aren't arresting him,
  they are just taking the guns, but they need warrants to remove the guns.
  Whenever you go to seize guns there is a heightened sense of danger. (4:00 PM
  Execution of Search Warrant) Randy knocks and tells Jeff to come out. A guy
  is standing and Randy tells him to get down at gunpoint because he has a gun
  on him and takes it. He asks if Jeff about the guns and he goes to get the
  key for the case and he tells him to sit. He says they can take all his guns
  and he's not happy about it so they give him the warrant. They make him move
  away from the guns and unload the gun from the guest. They go in the closest
  and pull out assault rifles. The other guy had a pistol in a holster on his
  hip when they came in, so it's not CCW. They find a huge box of steroids so
  Jeff's under arrest again.  He says they are the same ones from before. Under
  the bed are more guns and they start putting them on the bed and soon the bed
  is covered. Officer Chuck Pierce Jr. finds Jeff's drug sales book and there
  are lots of high dollar sales listed including one for $1,500. Randy by law
  has to make a list of all the things he's taking and knows he's going to be
  there awhile and starts with an Uzi. Chuck makes call to Jeff's relatives
  that they are arresting him and taking three semis, handguns, 100 pounds of
  ammo and 40-50 clips. Randy reads the label on the steroids that says "for
  vets to administer to horses only" and doesn't think he would take something
  meant for horses.
- (10:20 PM Suspicious Person) Northeast Area Command -- Officer Thomas
  Fletcher says he's been fascinated by cops since he was five and grew up
  watching every cops show he could watch. So he joined the Marine Corps,
  became a military policeman, got out and has was hired in Vegas. He goes to a
  hotel at the 2000 block of Freemont and tells Jerry who is drunk to come out
  of the bushes. He talks to Peggy who was hiding from him and has kids, says
  they aren't alone because she's paying for a babysitter. How does she afford
  it? Her boyfriend is in prison. She's been in Vegas for five days, she
  flushed her license, will show something else for ID. The drunk guy says she
  was paying $188 a week for a hotel and he was trying to find a cheaper place.
  She has Colorado ID, is going to dealer school and college? Which is it? She
  says they are the same. The guy says he sold his ID in 1987. They ask him why
  he did that. A guy needed it. The girl cries, says she has a 19 month old
  kid, she knows the guy's a punk and a trouble maker, but she just moved here.
  The cops know the drunk guy. The cops admit they don't know him and tell her
  to relax, she says she's not spazzing.  She met him at the Ambassador while
  playing some nickels slots and told him her story. Her mom died two weeks
  ago, she's from Clinton, IO and thought this place was like Reno. What's Reno
  like? Nicer. Tom is worried she's out drinking beer in the bushes while her
  kids are alone. She says they aren't and she has a 5 year old and a 2 year
  old. They remember seeing Jerry drinking behind the mini mart a few weeks
  ago. He admits he was there drinking. They tell him to go. He goes to get her
  bag and she tells him not to. They tell Peggy she can go and not to jump in
  the bushes with some scrounge she doesn't know. She says where she's from
  they believe people. She doesn't know anybody here and she holds stuffed
  animals. They say she knows them know. Give them a call if she needs anything
  from now on. They see a lot of people like that, they come with their
  boyfriends and they leave them after a week and they have nothing, no money
  no job, nowhere to go.
- (7:00 PM Disturbance Call) Northeast Area Command -- Officer Randy Sutton
  says the honest citizen has rights, to conduct his life free of being
  molested by burglars, rapists, gang members and other scum of the earth.
  Their job is to do the best they can to protect them from those leeches.
  It's like the bullies in school, he never liked them. They take advantage of
  the weak and it's their job to protect them. He goes to a 7-11 where a drunk
  man refuses to leave and now he's harassing customers out front. He asks the
  guy what's the problem. His shirt is open, his fat gut is exposed, he says no
  and walks away. Randy grabs him, says don't walk away from me and asks him
  why they got a call. He says his car got stolen, he's not harassing anyone.
  He tries to show his ID and says he's had a lot to drink. His car was on the
  corner there. He walks around and tries to smoke, but Randy doesn't want him
  to smoke. Want me to tell you what the truth is? Yes. He got high, gave money
  to a guy, thought he was his brother, gave him the keys and he took off.
  Randy asks what he was smoking. Rock. He gave the dealers his car so they
  could get more.  The car is a 1979 Ford Fairmont. How long has he been
  smoking? Do you want the truth? Yes. Randy mirandizes him. He says he'll tell
  him and understands his rights. He doesn't know the license plate number, but
  it's in his name though.  All the paperwork is in the glove compartment. He
  gave it to them an hour ago and never thought they would take it. He's been
  getting high with them for three days and knows where they live. He walks
  over and Randy says not to stand next to him. He wants to tell him. What were
  the guys' names? He can't tell.  Randy arrests him for being under the
  influence of drugs. He cuffs him easily and puts him in the car. On the way
  to the station Randy says cocaine isn't good for him. He asks him how much
  has he spent on dope in his life. He can't tell him, maybe $30-40,000 and
  it's not cheap.

- (Firing Range) Metropolitan PD -- Officer Randy Sutton fires two clips. He
  was involved in a shooting incident using a 9mm. They shot at each other
  about 5 feet apart. He hit him in the chest, the guy missed him, but the
  suspect didn't even know he was hit, it didn't make him flinch. He decided it
  was time to switch to a heavier caliber weapon, a 45. He doesn't know if
  it'll work better and hopefully won't find out. He then checks the target he
  was shooting at. (7:40 PM Person with a Gun Call) The man is supposed to be
  at the 7-11 near the airbase. He pulls up and walks up to a red car at
  gunpoint and makes the people inside put their hands up. The female driver
  comes out and he makes the passenger come out the same door. He asks what's
  going on and if he has a gun and he says yes. He makes him get his hands
  away, go down on his knees with his hands on head and then he cuffs him. He
  brings him over to his car, calls it in, and takes the gun. The guy says he's
  holding it for a friend.  She says she didn't know about it. He says he
  doesn't know if it's loaded, but it is. Backup arrives and searches him. They
  ask what his friends name is. He thinks about it for a while and says Ricky.
  He got it from a guy and got in trouble, so he's holding it for him. He's 19,
  he'll get concealment, and charged with having the serial number filed off.
  They find a bag of bullets, money and drugs. Everything is his, but the drugs
  are his friends.
- (Prostitution Sting) Officer Andrea Berman listens as Lt.  Bill Young
  explains the game plan -- a reverse soliciting targeting the Johns. Big
  problem lately, lots of them. He has Las Vegas Blvd drawn on the board.
  She'll take them into room 126 at an apartment complex. They'll have control
  room next door and two cops in the bathroom in her room. (11:40 PM) She walks
  on the street and guy pulls up. He says he works for the military and asks
  what pleases her. She says anything. He asks for a BJ and she says $20 and to
  meet her at apt 126. She tells him she just got there from California, has
  been there for two days and is getting all wet. She tells him to make himself
  comfortable and she'll go in the bathroom. Mike and Leon bust him. The guy
  says 'oh, no. It's embarrassing." They tell him it's worse to get AIDS. There
  are now 72 whores that have AIDS on the street. He'll get a citation and they
  don't want to see him again. (12:20 PM) A guy walks over, he has a half-ounce
  of crack he wants to exchange for sex and brings a friend. One guy smokes and
  the other has a bag of beers. He asks her if she goes fast. She doesn't
  understand and the cops jump out. She says the guy offered $20 for a BJ. She
  doesn't know what go fast is. The other guy wanted to have fun and has no
  money. The guy says he didn't have any meth, he was lying to her. The bring
  the hairy hippy guy with the beers says he was just going to sit there and
  drink beers and watch, he never made a deal. They let him go, then they find
  meth and needles on him and bring him back. Bill says he doesn't want those
  people in Vegas, if she wasn't a cop she would've been in trouble, that's the
  payoff.
- (11:00 PM Domestic Disturbance Call) Northeast Area Command gets a call and
  Randy is right there when it comes in. He pulls the woman out and she says
  she wants him out, doesn't want to live under the same roof, he's a drunk, it
  will help him. They've been married 30 years, and it's 30 years too long. He
  drinks all day, abuses her and tears her nerves to pieces. Randy can't remove
  him since he lives there. She tries to stay away all day so she doesn't have
  to be with him and can't even relax in her own damn trailer.  Officer Russell
  Peterson backs him up. He has no relatives and if he did they wouldn't take
  him. Randy goes in and talks to Jack. He has a wound on his arm and says she
  bit him and he called the cops on her. She says she's on medication and
  doesn't need it until she's around him. Randy asks her if she knows about the
  domestic violence law. She doesn't know. He says if violence happens within
  four hours of them arriving he has to arrest someone. She is under arrest,
  but she thinks Jack is having her arrested.  Randy says Jack doesn't know and
  he has to do it. She beat him with a broom and wants her purse. They'll get
  it. She says it's the most humiliating, disturbing thing.

- (7:20 PM Runaway Child) Metropolitan Police Dept -- Officer Randy Sutton goes
  to the call of Jessie, an eight year-old boy, who ran away an hour ago after
  a domestic dispute and hasn't been seen since. He pulls up to \#2645,
  clipboard in hand. The woman says he was beating up on some kids and she got
  done talking to him and sent him to his room until dinner and he might not
  get any. She never does that. Then her younger son Ricky told her he ran out
  the door with his backpack filled with toys. She went to the school, drove
  around to look for him, but didn't find him. Randy calls Gloria on the phone
  then there is a knock on the door. The neighbors found Jessie and returned
  him.  Randy calls the kid over and asks why he did it. He says Dave and
  cries. He says Dave hits him and all that, he's his baby brother's dad. He
  hits them both. Ricky says he doesn't hit him. Jess says he does. He kicks
  him in the head in the morning to get him to go to school. He shows a mark on
  his face from him. He ran away because of Dave and thought his mom would be
  better off without him. Randy says that's not true and he'll talk to them
  both if he promises not to run away again. She's holding a baby and says Dave
  never hit him with a belt, but he's threatened to use it. He's never been
  punched or slapped, but doesn't know how he got the mark on his face. He
  doesn't like Dave because he's strict with him, he's the only one who can
  keep him in line. She told him Dave would take care of him when he got home,
  that might be why he ran away. Randy sees no signs of abuse and lets him stay
  there. He leaves and thinks there is a grain of truth to the story, so he's
  filing a report on it.
- (10:30 PM Traffic Stop) Southeast Area Command -- Officer Dominick Rodriguez
  says if he can help someone out he'll do it.  That's the best thing when you
  see someone in a tight spot who needs help and you can come through for them
  it's a good feeling. He spots a small car run through a red light, it's one
  of his pet peeves because it causes a lot of accidents. Carrie is laughing
  when he walks up. She says it wasn't red when she went through and doesn't
  have her license because she left it at home.  She doesn't drink, doesn't do
  nothing. He writes her a ticket. She's never run a red light before. He has
  her sign the ticket.  She says deep inside she fells like he thinks she's
  really guilty. He says he's doesn't, don't be too upset about it, just don't
  do it again. She says she's shy and goes to start the car and it won't start.
  She says it's a bad alternator. She says it's a 4 speed and she's not good at
  push starting it. He says she has a complex.  He'll push her, pop it into
  second when she gets to the sign and it'll be ready to go. He pushes her with
  the police car, then pulls up next to her and she says she ran out of gas. He
  says he'll drive her to the gas station. She says it's really embarrassing.
  He takes her to a phone and she calls the wrong he number. Then she calls her
  mom Carol and can't handle it.  Dom talks to her, says he needs to give
  Carrie a ride home. He explains she has a leak and doesn't want to leave her
  at the 7-11, but he can't drive her across town, she'll be at Flamingo and
  Eastern. He feels safe leaving her there.
- Clark County Detention Center -- Lt. Patricia Kessel says the first time
  coming to jail has got to be a horrendous experience, she would be terrified
  and she's been there 12 years now. If you get someone shouting orders here
  and there, telling you do this, do that and you don't know what's happening
  to you, you are not a free person. It's understandable that you are upset.
  They teach officers IPC -- Inter Personal Communication. One of the most
  vital parts of their training program is to teach folks that when someone
  comes in and they are angry, calling you every obscene name in the book,
  clutching at you, grabbing at you or whatever, it's not you they are angry
  at, it's what you represent. They bring a drunk guy in and take his picture.
  He's an older guy, says he's got money and drives a Cadillac. They don't want
  to hear he's someone who knows the sheriff and everyone. Pat says they want a
  blood sample from him.  They don't want to grab them by the hair, it looks
  really bad, it's a tactic that hurts, but doesn't injure. It gets their
  attention, you have to get their attention before they'll listen to you. The
  guy from before hit his face on the wall and bust his nose and mouth. He's
  bleeding and a nurse cleans him up. Pat begs him to cooperate, they aren't
  there to fight. He needs to agree to submit.  He says he's not fighting with
  anyone. She says he just needs to do what they ask. He says he's not
  resisting and agrees to take a breath test, it's that or blood. Officer Jack
  Clark talks to a woman who is belligerent. She curses him out and wants the
  cuffs off, but he won't. She says someone needs to. She was caught giving
  oral sex in the back of a car and her fly is open. The guy from before says
  Jack hit him, someone hit him.  He explains he hit the wall outside.  Then he
  refuses the blood test so they take him off to the drunk tank. They smell
  alcohol on him. They'll let him calm down and sleep it off. They take blood
  from another guy who asks why they are doing it. He says he wants them to
  test it for every kind of disease. The guy from before got all squirrelly in
  isolation. He got the cuffs off and punched a cop right in the face. They'll
  have to file a report.  They've heard, "I know the sheriff, the governor, I
  pay your salary." She wants to ask them for a raise then.

  needed and go to the scene. Sgt. Doug Gillespie tells him 575 wants to know
  what's going on 44 and 420, ran out the back. Patrol went to a house to get
  someone on a homicide warrant and the guy took off out the back door. He's
  armed with a knife and wanted for battery with a deadly weapon. He says the
  guy hopped over the back wall. Mike goes around back with the dog into a
  garage and asks an owner if they can go into their backyard to search. He
  says it's the worst kind of search he can do, he's worried more about getting
  shot by a resident than a suspect. They think someone is trying to rob them
  and shoot out their window or let their dogs out. He doesn't find anything
  and hears cops calling because another K-9 unit found him. He's cuffed on the
  ground with the dog trying to get him. One dog almost gets him and they yell
  at him to walk past them. He walks like he has all the time in the world.
  Mike has to yell to get the dog to stop. The guy says he just pushed her
  away, he's told he has warrants for attempted assault and attempted sexual
  battery. Mike trades barbs with the other K-9 officer. He calls him a rookie
  and he found him first, Mike says his dog was calm enough to cuff him, Doug
  says he would be calm too since he didn't make the catch. Mike says it's
  beginners luck, he's still a rookie and can't lie, there is competition, he
  wanted to make the catch, but Eich thinks he did anyway, so he still thinks
  he's top dog.
- (4:00 PM Indecent Exposure Call) Officer Randy Sutton says there are 240
  million people in the country and only 500,000 cops. When you put on that
  uniform it's a lot of responsibility. The courts decided a cop can be sued as
  well as the department.  What he worked so hard to get can be removed from
  him if the court decides he violated someone's rights. He goes to the call of
  Tanya who can see a man in his apartment with the drapes open masturbating in
  the window. The woman is outside when he pulls up and she points to where he
  is, but can't see him now.  He backs up to get out of the way. She says he
  stands in the window with the curtains up and the window open and he plays
  with himself, it's embarrassing.  She's getting sick of it and he acts like
  he hides. Tanya will file a crime report on him. Randy knocks on B1 and the
  guy says he's alone and he's wearing nothing but a small towel around his
  waist. Randy mirandizes him and asks if he knows why he's here. He says what
  is he supposed to say, he has a problem with her, but doesn't know her. He
  has scars on his back, knows what he was doing was wrong, is not going to
  deny it, but it was a spur of the moment thing.  There was something about
  her, he saw her at the pool, liked the way she looked and thinks she's
  married. He's done it a couple times in front of her, but just her. He can
  see her across the way, finds her sexually attractive and there's not much he
  can really say. Randy tells him to get dressed. He has to go downtown and be
  charged with open and gross lewdness. If he's never been arrested they'll let
  him go. Is it necessary for him to be arrested. It's illegal to masturbate in
  front of women in Nevada.
- (12:15 AM Disturbance Call) Southeast Area Command -- Officer Dominick
  Rodriguez says he always wanted to become a cop, was raised in this town and
  knows it sounds corny but he loves his community. He wanted to be a cop since
  he was a kid and wants to participate in helping the community instead of
  complaining about it. There are people in the emergency room raising heck and
  refusing to leave. A woman points to security and says two young guys are
  drunk and creating a disturbance. Mike cut off the tip of his finger and
  wanted to be seen first and got obnoxious. He asked him to leave, he
  wouldn't, they are packed and she wants him out. She will file a trespass on
  him. They guy is on the phone when Dom goes in. He tells him to get off. He
  says he's been there 90 minutes, he needs stitches and needs help now. He has
  a bloody towel on his hand and called 911 and they said they have to help
  him. Mike says the guard is playing Mr. Hero, won't help him, he's there
  first. Dom says it's a private hospital and they don't have to take care of
  him. Mike says his uncle is Chuck Thompson and he'll take care of them all. A
  guy and a girl come over and start yelling it's a customer service problem.
  He asks if someone had a gun in his stomach would they wait? The guy comes
  back and says he's been bleeding for two hours and Dom says he'll arrest
  Donald for obstruction. They feel strongly about him leaving, he'll go in and
  talk to them. He talks to a woman who says it's not an emergency and not life
  threatening. He needs 2 maybe 3 stitches and he's only been there 30 minutes.
  The others are a priority, they take them in priority order, people came in
  by ambulance and he spread the wound apart to make it bleed. Mike says she
  told him it would be 5 stitches. The waiting process is part of the game. He
  denies he was there only 30 minutes. Dom sympathizes with them, but they have
  to play the game and wait, other people have problems too.

- (12:45 AM Shooting Call) Jersey City -- Officer Thomas Porter chose the job
  because his brother was in the department and most people on the block were
  cops, so he figured he might as well join. He's driving toward the WTC and
  says there's excellent job security, the money's not bad, the benefits are
  great and someone has to do it, doesn't mind helping people out once in a
  while, that's the job. Officer Robert Falconetti is his partner and they go
  to the call of a man shot in his car on Second and New York Ave. He is put in
  the ambulance since he's hit in the head. The car is off to the side on the
  curb with bullet holes in the window and spent shells on the ground so they
  leave it to the investigators. A call comes in that someone saw the shooter
  so they drive over to his backyard and eight cops chase down the tall black
  guy who says he doesn't know what happened. He's the right guy, but they
  can't find the gun that fired the 10 shots. (2:30 AM Shooting Call) Another
  shooting happened down the road, another fun night in the city. Tony is a
  black guy sitting on some stairs with a wound to the neck. They ask who shot
  him, he doesn't know, they took his wallet. They tell the ambulance to hurry
  since he's falling over.  Tom tells the guy to go and asks if he stutters.
  EMS arrives. It's common in the projects, close to the first of the month,
  today is the fourth, they've had enough time to get their checks and go
  crazy. They go out on foot and ask the people around if they saw anything,
  but no one says a thing. There are lots of violent crimes and no one wants to
  rat on their friends. It's the code of silence, if they rat on someone,
  they'll be next.
- Hoboken -- Sgt. Mike Plunkett asks the officers if they have their helmets
  and hands out their night sticks.  They are short handed with only four of
  them until 8 o'clock. Have a good night. His great-great grandfather was a
  cop there in 1876 and his family has lived there since.  There's not as many
  crimes as there used to be. Lots of the bars now cater to the yuppies,
  instead of the working class when he was a kid, lots more fights back then.
  (5:15 PM Disturbance Call) He's going to Redheads bar where the owner has a
  bat on a customer. The guy says a man threatened him over the phone with a
  bat. Someone broke into his house in Jersey City and has a bat with his name
  on it. They talk to the owner who says the guy charged $1300 on his account
  for City Paint and Johnny is getting billed for it. The guy says he used him
  as a reference and they sent the bill here by mistake. He says he bought
  stuff for the lady and they mistakenly assumed it was for Redheads.  They
  said to bill it to Redheads and he said fine. He's paying it right now.  He
  says Johnny told him his house was robbed. The Sgt. says the guy knew they
  were charging him and he gets tired of the guy talking and interrupting him.
  He yells at him to stop and tells Johnny he can file a complaint with the
  detective, it's a lot of money. He can file right now if he's threatened.
  Johnny says he didn't say it. The guy keeps saying he can't watch his back
  and the Sgt. believes Johnny. The guy keeps saying it's against the law to
  make threats and the account has been settled so he can do what he want.
  It'll be settled in court, not here. After Mike says people come from all
  over the world to see the NYC skyline and they see it every day. The shot
  includes the WTC.
- Orange PD -- Officer Dennis Vega says it's good to know the community you are
  in. He was born and raised there. Lots of the cops there were born and raised
  in Orange and are trying to give back to the town. He goes to a block party
  and shakes hands with people as do other cops. (3:15 PM Domestic Call) A man
  took his child from the mother so they go to her rundown apartment and talk
  to the mother. The door is bashed and smashed and has 'Jones' written on it
  in marker. He won't open the door so they call him on the phone and tell him
  to open the door. He puts the mom on the phone and she says she wants her
  baby, he tells her to screw off. Her friend has a shirt that reads 'If you
  don't like my attitude dial 1-800-eat-sh!t' right in front of her kids.
  Dennis gets back on the phone and says he wants to make sure the baby is OK
  and to clear the hall. He finally opens the door and is still on the phone.
  He surrenders the kid, shakes the guys hand and tells him he can't use their
  kid to solve their problems. It'll make him look bad, even if he's right.
  These kind of situations can be explosive. The job has lots of judgment
  calls. Over the credits the WTC is seen from a distance.

- (7:45 PM Code Red -- Officer Emergency) Metropolitan PD Southeast Area
  Command -- Officer Jack Clark says because of the area with the high
  concentration of bars and casinos they have a DWI problem. People are either
  walking or driving, then it becomes a much more serious problem to put a
  thousand pound car in the hands of a drunk. He pulls over a white rental
  Cadillac with the horn stuck. They pop the hood and he tells them they can
  pull it and take it back to Budget. Then it suddenly stops. Metrocom Center
  -- a call comes in for an officer down emergency. They radio Jack and he
  takes off. A cop got run over at Circus Circus, but they don't know if it's a
  real cop or security. He pulls up and Officer Frank Janise is down on the
  street with a stream of blood coming from his head. One man keeps him down,
  another holds his hand. Jack calls for an ETA on EMS. More people arrive and
  they caught the older male driver who hit him and has no license. EMS cuts
  Frank's jacket off. A witness says he had to chase the driver down the
  street. He wasn't sure what the guy was doing, he was trying to make up his
  mind what to do. He stopped and the man reached in and grabbed his keys. They
  think he's drunk and give him a field test. There was a DWI accident scene
  and Frank was there. The drunk ran through the scene and hit him. He's
  arrested for felony DWI because of the drinking and the injuries. They take
  Frank to University Medical Center for lacerations to his head, broken ribs
  and broken wrist. He was investigating a DWI and stopped traffic, the suspect
  drove through the accident scene, hit Frank and he went to leave. A guard
  chased him down and made him come back.
- (Seven Months Later) Officer Frank Janise talks about the accident. He
  arrived at the accident scene and went to get flares and find out about
  getting blood drawn for BAC. That's the last thing he remembers. He was told
  the man came across the Industrial road, went over the double line and hit
  him. The mirror on the truck hit him in the head and something cut through
  his shirt, jacket and vest. (5:50 PM Accident Call) He goes to where another
  cop has a man stopped and thinks he's drunk. Officer David Wagner explains
  the guy was making a westbound turn on Paradise, then a lady hit the back of
  the cab, plus there's a second accident. He gives the man a field test. Frank
  talks to the woman. She says the man sandwiched the guy between the truck and
  the cab almost killing him. (8:10 PM Accident Call) He goes to the call of a
  three car accident where paramedics have already arrived. He pulls up and the
  scene is full of people.  He talks to a blonde woman who says the white car
  tried to make a left hand turn and the red car didn't yield. The white car's
  front is smashed in and the red car looks like a tinfoil ball. He can relate
  to them better because he was never involved in a DWI accident until he was
  hit. Everyone had seatbelts except for one lady in an 85 Oldsmobile who only
  got lacerations. The driver was lucky he had his belt on so he survived. The
  old saying is if you drink, don't drive.
- (6:40 PM Suspicious Vehicle) Northeast Area Command -- Officer Thomas
  Fletcher has been assigned to the downtown area as a foot patrol officer.
  They run into a lot of homeless, a lot of robberies, find that a lot of their
  suspects come from in other cities. Then they find out they are also wanted
  back home, it's a very transient area. A red car is driving around a parking
  lot and they ask them what is the woman doing in the trunk of the hatchback
  and tell him to stop. He pulls over and they ask him why she is there. They
  were trying to get a room but it was $25. She has an Australian accent and
  says she's rode 5000 miles back there, that's why her leg is sore.  The
  driver says he's rode back there. Officer Joseph Lombardo says he wouldn't
  ride there. Everything she owns is inside there and they laugh about it.
  (7:10 PM Domestic Disturbance) A woman is supposed to be holding a baby on
  the street and park rangers have her. They pull up and she is gone. The
  ranger points to where they went. They are across four lanes of traffic. Joe
  walks over and there is a man, woman and kid standing there. Cindy is upset,
  says her husband beat her and the cops let him go again. He's drunk and has a
  warrant out for his arrest. She's putting tape on a large cardboard box on
  the ground. Her husband knew she didn't have any money, thinks he went home
  and left her there. The guy with her is a stranger who gives her some money.
  He says it won't help much, but she shouldn't be out here like that. Her
  daughter is two and she told him she was going back to her parents in
  Phoenix. He was going to take her to get her check and he dropped her off
  there and left. He wants her to go and he told her so. She has no money,
  except what the guy gave her. She was going to get $128 from her check and
  Greyhound bus tickets as $32. Cops take her box, put it in their trunk and
  will go to Greyhound, they have some money. They drive her to the huge bus
  terminal and ask when the next bus is to Phoenix. It's 12:15am. They buy her
  a ticket and tell her if he shows up again tonight and tries to force her to
  do anything to tell the front desk and they'll come as fast as they can.

- (Truck Sting Operation Briefing) Jersey City -- Captain Bobby Martin says
  many trucks are getting broken into and getting hit heavy after getting
  steered off the turnpike down one way streets with no way to turn around.
  Conrail loaned them a surveillance van used in Boston. Chief Inspector Art
  Dunn from the Conrail PD shows it off on the inside. Zenith gave them empty
  VCR, camcorder and TV boxes and they are glued and taped together to look
  flush. The giant crate on the left side is where the cops hide and it opens
  up to block the thieves in by wedging against the with a board on the floor.
  It's set up nice so they'll run inside and grab the equipment. They are in
  back of the projects. Officer Paul is driving the 18 wheeler Trailvan and
  pretends he broke down. He gets out, pops the hood and a black guy comes
  right up to him, then Paul leaves it. Seconds later three black kids come up
  to break the seal with a stick. (5:15 PM Truck Interior) Officer Andrew
  Lancellotti explains to the rest how many will come in and then they can open
  it. There's a bathroom and a long bench to sit inside the large crate. The
  kid in a white shirt and red shorts goes back to get a broom to break the
  seal. They are so excited when they get in and run saying "VCRs!!" Police
  jump them and they are surprised.  They say they'll drive it over to Duncan
  and Sgt. Walter Barrett follows them over. They explain to Paul which way to
  turn and open the hood so they can see it better then he walks away from the
  truck. (7:55 PM) A black kid in white shorts works on the lock. He gets it
  open and excitedly signals his friends to come. When one joins him they jump
  them, but the second guy gets away. The first guy says they made him do it.
  When they pull him out of the truck a group of women laugh at him. He says
  he's 14. It starts to get dark so they call it off. He says they'll meet up
  and get them out of the back and they are thankful. Tomorrow they'll start
  earlier.
- Captain Bobby Martin says they did a good job yesterday and will do it again
  today. It's a big industry, a billion dollars a year of theft. They are going
  back to Duncan. We see cops have to enter the crate from a trapdoor in the
  bottom of the truck. They stop near a park and call the truck. They tell him
  to turn the nose their way. He pops the hood and fiddles with the engine to
  make it look good. He goes in and grabs his briefcase and walks away. (3:30
  PM) There is a large pack of black men across the street. One of them grabs a
  screwdriver and heads over as another becomes a lookout. The guy gets the
  lock off and madly jumps in and is grabbed. The others jump through the door
  and grab the second guy. It's Christmas in August, they are setting up again.
  There are only certain streets in the city designated for trucks and people
  will steer them the wrong way so they can rob them. The move the truck to a
  new street. (6:15 PM) Four guys appear and one goes in the cab. A Hispanic
  man in a white hat pops the seal and calls to his buddies "VCRehs!" He grabs
  one, they jump him and drop out the bottom and grab the others. He says he
  has no dope on him, his hat comes off on the way out and says he's the only
  one to blame. He uses a hand pumper as the tool. It took only six minutes for
  them to park and break in.
- Captain Bobby Martin says they do a lot of proactive and reactive stuff
  patrolling hot areas where there are purse snatchings and house entries.
  Where there is bad crime they will set up and let them do the crime and catch
  them in the act, they are the witnesses in court. It's not a victim, it's the
  police as witnesses, so 9 times out of 10 they'll cop a deal. (12:10 AM
  Suspicious Situation) They spot Rob going in and out of a super market with a
  bag in the pouring rain. The bag was empty at first, now it's full. They
  watch him for a while to see where he goes. He goes up 5th and they stop him
  in the street. They ask if he bought the stuff, but he has no receipts. He
  threw them away and has no money left. He has 20 packs of cigarettes. Rob
  looks familiar to them and they ask him if he got busted for breaking into a
  car. He says he doesn't do that stuff, but they did bust him 2 1/2 weeks ago.
  They saw him outside the Pathmark for 20-30 minutes and go back to the store
  to see if he bought them. A manager says he saw Rob there, but he didn't buy
  anything. Officer Andrew Lancellotti asks if can they ID the stuff. The
  cigarettes have a 4004 number on them that is the code for the store. He was
  running around, that why he didn't have a receipt. He stashed a bag by the
  diner and came back and grabbed more and went back. He was waiting for the
  rain to let up. He was there since 11 PM. Special thanks to Chief Richard J.
  Harrison.

- (10:45 PM Roll Call) Jersey City -- The Sgt. tells officers the Puerto Rican
  parade goes down to Grundy Park so give it special attention.  That's it. One
  cop says he's on motorcycle 56. Officer Thomas Porter says what he likes most
  is the people he's with, they are a rare breed, not many people like to work
  at midnight and sleep all day. His partner is Officer Robert Falconetti who
  says there is less traffic, it's more informal, a different class of people
  and is best shift in the city (Saturday 11:56 PM Assault Call) Thomas says
  there are lots more violent crimes, it's not Mayberry. They go up to Daisy
  who says her boyfriend Ruben Trinidad punched her in the head and scratched
  her with a knife. He took the keys and dropped the knife. He's riding a bike,
  in a white t-shirt, black shorts and a blue Morley's hat. They know him and
  go to a park where he hangs out. He's been arrested before, everyone knows
  him, not a great guy, every cop and everyone in town knows him. He'll
  probably come back, he's stupid enough to. There are a bunch of guys sitting
  at a table who say Ruben left an hour or so ago. They talk to Mike on a
  corner who says he hasn't seen him all day as a pack of people behind him
  make noise. They say to call if he sees them and go back to Daisy and her
  friends to see if he came back. She needs to go to 762 Montgomery St. on
  Monday to file a complaint unless they catch him first. He'll come back, he's
  cocky.
- (Thursday, 9:40 PM Assault Call) They get a call of a female being assaulted
  right where Daisy was last time. It turns out she is Daisy. A woman says he
  tried to get her again, busted his eye open and he's out inn the back yard.
  They go out there and it's totally dark. Ruben is down on the ground by an
  underground door. He was trying to climb into a window to escape, fell and
  hit his head. He's Mexican, with a big dorag. He says, "I can't stand up, I'm
  dizzy yo." Tom is going to cuff him and Ruben says he's tough, he'll show him
  how tough he is even when he's cuffed. Tom says he's tough too. Ruben says
  he's a punk, he can't beat him one on one. Daisy says she didn't want to be
  with him once he got drunk. They were all hanging out together and then it
  got bad. She is holding ice on her face and doesn't care what they do to him
  now. They are charging him with assault.  He says he doesn't need to be
  charged with that. He ends everything with yo and curses them out. He says he
  can curse all he wants and is going to court on Monday for beating up a cop
  and didn't resist. They have him in a cage and ask him to spell his name and
  he says to make sure they spell it right, like Trinidad and Tobago. He hangs
  all over, that's why they can't find him. He's been locked up many times, has
  an extensive record, no girls like him and they reject him so he beats them
  up. She signed a complaint on him and the state has the toughest domestic
  violence laws in the country.
- Orange, NJ (10:20 PM Street Patrol) Officer Dennis Vega says most of the time
  he winds up doing what he's taught, not on the job, but when you were
  younger, how to treat people and how to react in different situations. If you
  get physical that doesn't solve things it creates new problems. If you fight
  with everyone you are not going to make it, this is not the job for it. A
  black guy flags him down and says his cousin has a problem with his sister
  and his kids. He says there is going to be a fight, but he can't explain it.
  He wants Dennis to go there, but he won't until he understands. He says the
  cousin and his ex are fighting over their kid and he'll ride down there on
  the hood if he wants. It started right there and now they're by the ice cream
  parlor. He says he's a short bald fucker. The guy runs down there and Dennis
  meets him at the corner. A woman says the guy is lying on Bell Street all
  beat up. A witness says a guy beat him up and left him there.  The guy is on
  his back spread out and mumbling.  He indicates he can't breathe and can't
  move his leg. He starts crying and screaming. Dennis calls an ambulance. The
  cousin holds him down. The guy starts screaming and moving his legs because
  he wants him off him. He wants him to shut up. He keeps trying to get up and
  T holds him down. EMS arrives and T wants them to help, but the victim
  doesn't want their help, he can do it his own way, so Dennis calls them off.
  They started fighting on Jefferson St., he got bopped, is probably on the
  pipe and couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag. There was nothing the
  police could do about it, just can't let it get out of control and won't
  solve anything tonight.

- (12:47 AM Disturbance Call) Hoboken -- Officer Mike Plunkett became an
  officer for the same reason most people do -- to change the world, be
  somebody's knight in shining armor, rid the city of all crime. It's a good
  attitude to have when you first come on, you need that, but when you're on
  the streets a few weeks the reality check is you won't be a knight on shining
  armor, you can't change the streets and the best you can do is make your
  world a little better. When you retire you'll have a pretty good career to
  look back on. If you can survive 25 years you've got it made. It's usually
  around the time when the bars start closing and there are a lot of problems.
  They centralize themselves in the areas where the bars are in case of
  problems. He pulls up to a bunch of guys fighting on a sidewalk. Two groups
  separate as one man in a blue shirt fights and a cop grabs him. A citizen
  takes his cuffs and cuffs the guy. His friend wants to take him home. They
  say too late, he's under arrest. They say some guys threw him around and
  tossed him out. Ten guys did it, but they didn't get thrown out. Why is
  getting arrested, they came out and found him? He assaulted a cop. Mike says
  he listened to him, now he can go home. How can he, that guy is his ride. He
  doesn't care. Det. Brian Murphy says they went to take him out and he got
  loud and abusive and didn't want to listen and pushed him around, he didn't
  get hurt, just winded. Mike talks to the suspect at the station. He says he
  had his drinks, no problems, was having a good time. Then somebody said
  something to him, he came back, said something again. Then bing bang boom he
  hit the guy, but he didn't know he was a cop or he wouldn't have touched him.
  He should've looked first. He's sure Mike's been in a position like that
  before. No. You won't admit it. He then realized he was a cop. Maybe you had
  too much to drink. I did. He can live with that. After Mike asks how could he
  not know he was a cop, he was in full uniform. It wasn't like he was wearing
  a Good Humor uniform. He was blind drunk. He'll get a summons, be home in an
  hour, should spend a weekend in county jail, maybe he'll think twice before
  whacking a cop again.
- Jersey City (Narcotics Unit Briefing) Sgt. Brian McDonough says they caught a
  girl with cocaine and she told them there was a house with two Spanish chicks
  selling cocaine out of there. They have a warrant and it's the top apartment
  \#129. Sgt. Edwin Gillen says she's an old heavy woman, over 50, maybe 45.
  Brian explains how they will go up and batter the door, it's the weekend,
  don't get hurt for it. Det. Dennis DeSefano says they are Medellin and
  laughs. (11:45 PM Service of Warrant) He says when they see the last man go
  in, Mike, go down the block and cover the sides of the building in case
  something comes out the window. They go up, knock, say 'Policia', then ram
  the door. A woman can be heard. Inside there are babies crying, they grab the
  woman and make her sit, they find an older woman, a man and three babies they
  secure. Dennis grabs wads of cash that are in a purse.  They also find a
  welfare bundle of cash. The government is good to them. She laughs. They
  search her and make the family speak to her in Spanish and tell her to turn
  over any drugs or weapons. They also find a room of stolen clothes, all still
  have tags on them, enough for a 100 people. It's like doing inventory for JC
  Penney. One has a tag for $50. They rob stores and trade them for drugs.  Six
  suitcases full of kids shoes, a $75 David Benjamin dress, his wife doesn't
  wear those and $60 pants. The woman in yellow says she likes it, she uses it.
  Good country, eh? The kids all scream and now they are worried about the kids
  when they are taking them out for locking up the grandmother. He's worried
  about the kids while they deal. They see that and hate the cops, he would too
  if he was a kid. Brian says the grandmother was hiding in the closet with a
  couple grams of coke, she was the one in charge. They have a little bit of
  drugs and a lot of money, a lot of jewelry too. The daughter is in the cage
  yelling. They find an Irish good luck ring are any of them Irish? Did you go
  to St. Michael's High School in 1972? It's not the families jewelry it's
  someone else's.

      truck it was. They are from the factory back there, it's a white truck.
      It's a candy caper. Thomas jokes for them to be under arrest and they all
      do and laugh. They doubt the thief will come back and the kids are having
      a ball with it, the candy is probably bad, but they'll let them have fun
      with it.
    - This final section is only shown in the new, censored version: (1:47 AM)
      They find a car turned on its side. They parked it in front of a gate

      at them so the cops help out and turn the car back over.

  unless she is bleeding. They tell her to go to her mother's or go to jail

  he tried to get the carriage up over the curb and it fell twice and the kid
  fell out both times.  The original witness is also there and saw them drunk
  and fighting. They were in a bar drinking with the kid and passed the kid off
  to some derelict so they could fight. Child Youth Services is advised so a
  relative can be called.  Thomas talks to the mom and says she needs to put
  the baby's well being ahead of her fun. She says her baby is with her, she
  takes the baby with her when she goes drinking since she can't get a
  babysitter. She says if she wants to go out with her man, that's fine. Thomas
  says she isn't getting it. She says if the kid fell why come she not bruised.

  problem. He asks Roy if he wants to see him milk it. Roy doesn't. He says

  grazed him.  He'll be in the hospital a few days. One is arrested for assault
  and the rest are pending.
- (Street Patrol) Officer Gary Lynch says he is very active in his church and
  feels sorry for a lot of the people he deals with and understands a lot of
  the problems they have. When he first contacts them his whole rapport is he
  doesn't have to fight or arrest them. He doesn't want to do it, if he is calm
  and polite then they'll give him the same respect. (10:12 PM Domestic
  Dispute) A call of a family fight at a neighbor's house. They hear noises, no
  other info. They go up to the apartment complex and knock on the door with a
  Merry Christmas sign on it. The woman is below, says it's her apt. The guy
  was punching the wall and said he was going to kill her. Her 8 month old baby
  is in there and she is crying that her kids are freezing. Gary says to drop
  the kids at a neighbors' until they can get it sorted out. He's been
  drinking, just got home from a bar, has a knife and told her he would kill
  himself. Gary wants to ask the manager for a key, but she doesn't want him to
  do that. He told her if she called the cops he would shoot her. Gary says he
  might not mean that. She says he means it. A neighbor comes to take the kid.
  She says they have no phone and it's apt 38, so he goes to the manager. The
  man says he needs his wife. She gives them a key that should work. He goes
  and tries the key, but it doesn't work. They go to maintenance and get a
  ladder to climb up on the balcony to get in the sliding glass door. They get
  in and call for Danny and get no answer.  Gary grabs the baby out of the crib
  while other cops search for him. He hands the baby to the fat mother who is
  busy smoking and hits the kid with the cigarette. Danny's hand is cut open,
  he says it's from hitting a glass picture and wants a cigarette. He's under
  arrest. Paramedics are going to check him out first. She is upset, can't
  believe he is going along with it. He's been arrested for domestic before and
  so has she, it's nothing new to her.
- (8:04 PM Burglary Call) Officer Steve McGuigan says the public perceives them
  as being different, cold hearted and mean, but they are people too who grew
  up the same as everyone else. When they get off the job they all do different
  kinds of things and people perceive them differently. He goes to a park at
  night and plays basketball with young kids. He hits a shot and says they owe
  him a dollar and he'll be back for it. Another unit spotted a suspect,
  doesn't know what for yet and he drives over to assist. The apartment was
  burgled and they got a good boot print on the door and fingerprints. He's now
  supposed to be at the Red Dog drinking. They'll have the victim call him at
  the bar and make sure he is there so they can bust him. The guy says he stole
  a microwave and some 8 track tapes.  The guy says he got all belligerent and
  he needed to leave. He calls to talk to Richard and says to go out by the
  phone, he's got his money, he'll be there in 5 minutes. They drive there, but
  have no probable cause so they will just interview him and see what he says.
  They find him walking into the bar and he agrees to talk. He's all nice and
  turns over a pocket knife. He says he worked phone sales for the guy. He
  checks his boots and says they scuff nice. He says he kicked the door a
  couple days ago and denies knowing anything about a microwave or 8 track
  tapes and doesn't know they had that. It's Friday, he kicked the door on
  Wednesday. He agrees to go over there and talk to the guy.  He's not mad
  about the money. They tell him witnesses say the door was clean yesterday, so
  he's under arrest, put the cigarette out. He kicked it Wed or Thurs. They
  find the stolen stuff behind a bush and want to check it for prints first.
  Forensics arrives to dust for prints and finds good prints on the door and
  the property. He then admits he stole the stuff at 5-6pm and stashed it. He
  has no electricity, so he was holding it for ransom until he got the $16 back
  he owed him.

  patch holder for the Hell Angels or into it themselves. They are going to a
  meth lab is in a house and they don't know the status, if it's going to be
  bubbling or boxed up. Deputy Steve Peters says it's nerve racking, he gets
  butterflies, doesn't know if they are going to be home, if there are dogs,
  guns or what. They pound on the trailer and tell them to come out and they
  try to sneak out the back. They catch Sean and Shana out back. He says the
  guy is a friend of his from high school and he boogied out the back door, so
  he followed him. Shana says she's 20 and has a pipe on her.  They find a
  plate of meth freshly cut, bags of pot and a M-16 with the serial numbers
  shaved off. Guns and dope always are together. They catch another group of
  people including Denise who is crying she came there with her dad. They check
  a girls' eyes and ask when was the last time she used speed. She denies it
  and is only 16, so they arrest her for being under the influence. Denise says
  she didn't do speed, her pupils are huge because she's scared. They say it
  doesn't work that way, so she says she smoked pot. Mom arrives and tells the
  16 year old that she played with a rattlesnake and got bit. She says mom, not
  now.  Mom is pissed and wants them to take her to jail. They aren't going to
  and she's willing to pay them to do it. She says the guy she's with isn't her
  boyfriend and shows them a picture of the guy. The girl doesn't think she
  screwed up and doesn't want to get in the car. She says she just dropped

  he says there are 2 DOA, no suspects. The daughter and the son in law found
  them. Deputy Tom Segobia says they came in, found the step mother dead on the
  floor and the dad face down in the bedroom in a pool of blood. No one else
  lived there and no one stays with them. She thinks Carlos their neighbor was
  home, but doesn't know if he saw anything. They came over to borrow a
  chainsaw from her dad, knocked, no one answer, the door was unlocked, so they
  went around back and heard the dogs barking. She saw Carla there, couldn't
  get the phone to work, so she went next door. Tom tells her to hang tough,
  but she asks about her dad. He doesn't want to say, but admits he was found
  shot in the bedroom and he's dead. She breaks down. Tom says he hates this,
  there's no reason they should be dead.
- (6:52 PM Homicide Investigation) Detective Fred Breitkreuz says the back door
  was pried open, so that's where they'll start.  Detective William Frogue says
  they'll probably be out there all night long.  Inside the woman still has
  expensive jewelry on and a phone is in her hand. It doesn't look like a
  robbery since the TV is still there. (4:32 AM) Deputy Coroner Bob Overman is
  going to take the liver temperature to see how long they've been dead. It's
  62 degrees, which means they've been dead 12-18 hours.  They find blood on
  the side of the fridge and possibly gunpowder. (7:12 AM) They remove the

  should and they'll regret it later when they get docked pay. He takes a call
  and pulls up to Maurice standing outside of his car. He tells him to put his
  hands up and he had a problem the other night. He says he didn't. Duke opens
  the trunk and there's a huge speaker inside. Maurice says he talked to her
  parents, told them he's 18, she's 14, they understood that. They thought he
  was going to rape her, he says he's not like that. They went to a party, she
  got drunk and said she was so horny in front of five guys. Deputy Heidi
  Godfrey says it's illegal for him to have sex with her. He knows, but she
  insisted saying she was ready. He didn't want to at first, but she assured
  him no one would find out. He says she wasn't drunk last night and he bought
  her an expensive ring. She says she loves him a lot, doesn't care if she got
  pregnant and wants kids. He asked for the ring back after what she did last
  night. Then she got mad and accused him of rape last night. He has two marks
  on his neck, she gave him a hickey and he gave one back. He says if it's love
  age shouldn't matter. They explain it's the law. He's arrested for unlawful

- Segment 1 and 2: (10:08 PM Disturbance Call) Sheriff's Dept -- Deputy Eugene
  Lancaster works the unincorporated parts of Harris county, in the last few
  years crime has gotten a lot worse, mostly drugs, especially crack. They're
  undermanned and always busy. A man is breaking windows with a pipe. Eugene
  goes up the dark driveway to a rundown house. A woman says her boyfriend done
  beat the windows in and took off. She saw him throw a ladder through a window
  and broke three others and the air conditioner. She was over his house and
  her car died and he left her there. They pushed the car to Circle K and the
  tow truck driver brought her home. He did it because he was drunk and thinks
  she's screwing around with the neighbor. They have two kids together and her
  grandfather lives with her and Eugene explains to her what to do if she wants
  to file charges. There is a gun on the table and Eugene holds it as he
  explains it.  They guy isn't there, so he can't arrest him. They'll have to
  sign a statement saying he did it. Suddenly shots are fired in the yard. He
  calls for backup 42-40 and then runs out and hunts the guy down.
- He is in the yard in a red shirt and jeans. He tells him to get down and
  cuffs him. He says not to move, to shut up and asks him where the gun is. He
  says he has no gun.  Eugene searches for it and tells him to shut up. He
  calls in that the guy is in custody. The woman comes down smoking and wanting
  the two jackets he's wearing saying they are hers. The man says he drank a 12
  pack of beer and a pint of whiskey -- that's it. He doesn't care anymore,
  doesn't smoke crack.  As they are driving back to the station a torrential
  rains starts. He says he was filing a criminal mischief report, got shot at,
  it scared him to death and was not a good feeling. He didn't see the guy,
  made a run for it and caught him. (11:22 PM) They arrive at the station, take
  the first door on the right and Cpl Jim Haley questions him. The drunk says
  that his girlfriend got him disappointed and no woman in the world should get
  you disappointed when you are drinking trying to have a good time. When the
  car breaks down and they blame you that isn't right. He's not an alcoholic or
  anything, he doesn't like it, that's the way he is that's the way it's gonna
  be! That's the way he grew up and that's the way it's gonna be. He gets
  angry. You don't know where he grew up or where comes from. You don't and
  nobody else will. It makes him mad. He's worse than Rambo. He doesn't use a
  gun. He's the only one who can change it. He doesn't smoke crack. He is an
  alcoholic, he drinks the cheap whiskey. He is dying anyway of cirrhosis of
  the liver, but no one believes him. He's been through a stomach staple, he's
  been through hell, more than Rambo. He can't stop, he can't stop today, why
  should he? He ain't never tried to kill anyone or hurt anyone, he did break
  some teenie windows.  Whenever he gets out he's not going to stop. As long as
  she treats him wrong he'll treat her like shit. If she treats him right,
  he'll treat her right.  They've been together for 4 years. He has 2 kids -- 2
  years and 4 months and 8 months. He hopes his kids see this so they'll be
  worse than him. He knows his one boy will be worse, he hopes he is. A man
  won't take shit from a woman. He doesn't want people messing with him when he
  has a good time. He says he doesn't drink that much, when someone gets him
  pissed off he gets pissed off. Jim asks shim if he wants help for his
  drinking. He says he doesn't need help, he just pissed off, it would be
  throwing money out the window. He cries and says he loves his kids, he
  could've got shot. Then he asks if it will cost anything. He says counseling
  is free and he admits he needs help.
- (2:52 AM Disturbance Call) Harris County Sheriff's Dept -- it's lunchtime.
  They are stuffing hot dogs down. Deputy Michael Sieck says his partner Deputy
  Bubba Hunton wears a hat, but his head is too big to fit in the car. Bubba
  says he's a native Texan and he likes wearing a cowboy hat, it goes natural
  with him. They take separate cars and hope it'll be a quiet call. Karen says
  for the guy to tell them. The guy says he rents a room to a friend and they
  got into a fight over the renter's woman. He has no shirt on and the guy has
  no pants on. The woman says the owner wants to sleep with her. The renter
  says the owner hit him in the face. She asks the owner to tell the truth that
  he came to her house and harassed her. She says not to turn his dad gum back
  on her. She has a 20 month old son and doesn't want to deal with it. All
  three of them smoke. Bubba says a tenant has rights and he has a right to
  have a woman over. The owner doesn't want her there. The renter says he wants
  her there. Bubba says she has to leave or she can leave with them. Bubba says
  if Karen doesn't leave he can arrest them all. She goes to leave and curses
  the owner out. Mike says 'he's fixin to jail her'. She gets so mad because he
  wants to screw her and she just wants to be friends. Mike says she shouldn't
  come over there and flaunt it front of him. She says she's not flaunting it.
  He says it's a figure of speech, she's in front of him. She says she didn't
  like him because he had no front teeth and was ugly looking.

  traffic because they spend 8 hours a day on the road. The passenger comes out
  and smells of alcohol. Investigator Baron Phillipson and Deputy Al Hernandez
  say to Lt. Robert Baton it is now a criminal investigation because she is
  drunk and the officer is injured. Darin will be in hospital for 48 hours of

  or they wouldn't be there. Patrol Officer Hank Glenn and Patrol Officer King
  Harris listen. (Highway Patrol) King says he's been there 20 years, 90% of
  the time in high crime areas. They go on a lot of felony calls -- robberies,
  shootings, burglaries and rapes. Any time they go with a report of a gun and
  do not know if the suspect is still on scene, mentally they have to be
  prepared, have to make it a safe situation. Any call could be a gun battle or
  a tussle. (Communication Center) A 9 year old boy calls in that his father is
  stopping a burglar, but doesn't know his address. The father comes back and

  the steps in the back where the man lives and is naked. They yell to put the
  gun down and come out, but have to go up and get him. The guy says, "I'm
  through, put it in the paper!' again and again. He struggles, tries to bite
  them and they can't hold him down because he's too slippery from sweat and
  blood. He gets up and almost gets out the door by running and crawling. They
  hit him with a metal chair, pull him down and lose their cuffs. They go to
  cuff him again and Sgt. Raymond Convery calls for a wagon. He's shot in the
  arm and spurting blood all over. The two guys were shooting at each other
  upstairs. If they shot at the cops they would've shot back, unfortunately the
  victim might've gotten shot. The naked guy is the burglar, the victim owns
  the barbershop and lives above it. He doesn't know the suspect. He fired at

  insurance. He is Middle Eastern, doesn't know the guy, it was a few blocks
  away where it happened. He left his keys in the car and went in a store. The
  guy just took it, couldn't drive because he was impaired. The Sgt. knew he
  couldn't drive, but didn't know it was stolen. The suspect doesn't even know
  his own name. They take him to the station. Sgt. Victor Ramirez says he came
  wrong way down a one way with people chasing him, yelling at him to stop. He

  break into a car on 3rd and McKean. Dan gets out and takes one guy down. Mike

  lady, but it's a guy. Joe has lipstick on, is holding a wig, wearing a
  leopard print leotard and has on stockings. They ask him what's going on and
  he says, "There was a damn cop that didn't help him." What happened to his
  knee? He fell chasing him. He was in his truck, a man came over to him and he
  opened the window. He says everything he has in his wallet is gone. He wants
  to secure his semi-truck so the rest doesn't get stolen. He's parked next
  block over. All of his paperwork is in the wallet. He's a tall guy, dark
  hair, black pants, he doesn't have time for this, every document he's got is
  in his wallet. He doesn't know his name. He took off and he chased him to the
  light. What's he look like? White guy, black hair, his height, his age. He
  wasn't in the truck with him, how many times does he have to say that? He
  pulled over to get some rest. He has tears in his stocking and bloody
  scrapes. Officer Charles Gravis backs them up. He saw a cop when he was
  chasing him and he wouldn't help. It's not right. He gets back in his cab and

  that wasn't in her shoe. If it was there, she would've felt it when she was
  walking. She says, "please officer -- tonight's not my night." She checks her
  socks and says it couldn't have been in her shoe, if you walk on it then it

  Chris Wellman always wanted to be a cop, but had to get his foot in the door,
  so he went in the Marines and came back to be a cop where he was born and
  raised. Cops tried to pull a guy over which led to a chase in the loop area.
  He is in a truck and not going very fast with many cops behind him. They
  would do a PIT, but they are not allowed to on high up vehicles. The driver
  holds up a cross when they pull up to him as they get permission to box him
  in. He is surrounded and won't come out so they break the window. The man is
  Mexican and says, "You are all going to be sorry, god bless you. God is here
  with me." He has Q-tip crosses taped on the windows and a cross taped on the
  back. Officer Michael McBride tried to pull him over. He was laying on the
  horn the whole time as he told him to stop. He drove away and started laying

  constant. Officer Tegan Broadwater tries to take nothing home and tell no
  stories, but his wife keeps hitting him up for information though he likes to
  keep it on the street. They pull a woman over and she digs through a pile of
  papers. They ask what she is doing. She was visiting her friend Cassandra on
  Rosedale and Hemphill, hasn't been anywhere else. She hasn't stopped anywhere
  even though they saw her. They pull her out and she keeps pulling her lip up
  showing her teeth. They search her pockets and all she has is a phone number.
  Then she says she stopped at another friends house since she is a stripper
  and has a lot of friends and thinks they are messing with her. She says she
  has a point and a spoon in the car and is willing to get naked if they want
  since she does it for a living. She pulled a muscle in her leg and needs help
  to sit. They find a bag of needles and a spoon. She says she gets high after
  work, only spends $20 a day and used to spend $300 a day. She rambles on and
  on about her mom and going to court for not having headlights. She got off at
  7:30pm, went to a house and shot up at Cassandra's. They find some unused
  drugs. She just got out of jail for heroin, now she's going back.

  works with the CCRT unit, Crime Response Team, whatever tasks they give them
  they deal with. He grew up on the east side, joined the Air Force, didn't
  think about being a cop, just ended up there. He pulls up behind two guys
  about to drag race. He thinks they are going to call it off and they race
  anyway. He turns on the lights as they speed off and he gets the first guy to
  pull over and the second guy soon after. He thinks the Camero is going to
  u-turn and run on him, but he stays put. Ernesto tells them he was right
  behind him and they didn't see him. Alvin in the Ford is 39 and says the guy
  in the Camero was teasing him the whole way. Ernesto admits he saw him
  taunting him and he fell for it. The guy in the Camero is 25 and says he
  wasn't breaking the speed limit and he wasn't racing. Ernesto laughs. First
  guy and says he was having fun, but this isn't the place, someone could get
  killed. The Camero guy didn't mean no harm. Ernesto says if these lose
  control they could wipe someone out. Alvin says he was playing catch up, he
  would've caught him. He gives them tickets and says they have raceways they
  can take it to. They should've looked in their rearview at least before they

  decided to get into law enforcement when he was five. He was working at a
  racetrack that his dad was part owner of and one day his dad saved him from a
  wild race car making all this noise and he took off running and he grabbed
  him and he always looked up to him for that. Two black men were seen trying
  to steal tires off a car in a dealership on the main road. They find one
  hiding under a red car as the K9 looks for the second one. They all run down
  the road and catch him in a parking lot. The guy screams, wails and cried to

- (Fort Worth, TX -- 12:58 AM Car Pursuit) East Division -- Officer Brian Clark
  enjoys working the midnight shift. When the call load goes down he can be
  more proactive and it looks for things. The shift works out because when he's
  going home his 2 and 4 year old are waking up so he can play with them.
  Fortunately for his son and daughter they got his wife's good looks and not
  his chiseled features. A car runs a stop sign at Ave K and he chases him
  until he bails at Ave L. They get out, but don't go far and he holds two
  Mexican men at gunpoint and tells them to get on the ground. The passenger
  has trouble listening, the driver doesn't come out and another passenger ran
  away. A woman comes out of the house they pulled into and wants to know
  what's going on. Brian tells them they ran from the police. The driver says
  he ran because he didn't want his father's car to get towed and he doesn't
  have a license. Brian says it will get towed now and all he would've gotten
  was a ticket. The guy in the orange pants lives there, the driver doesn't.
  He's been to jail before and says the car isn't stolen and he almost wiped
  out on the last turn. The new law in Texas is that if you run from the police
  it's a felony. They find a Coke can filled with paint in the car and the
  driver says he knows the paint is bad, he's not in a gang and knew better
  than to run.

  asks him why he's doing this, his son is probably watching him. He says he
  did nothing wrong, has nothing, but he finds speed on him. He says he's
  working on getting his license and he hasn't had a license for 10 years. His
  truck is dirty from working. He finds a bit of weed in the truck. Phil finds
  it interesting that Fred has a D.A.R.E. shirt on since he's sending the wrong
  message. The Sgt. backs him up. Fred can't believe he is getting arrested, he
  did nothing wrong. Phil asks about the shirt, he says it's a hand me down
  shirt he uses for work, he's a bricklayer, he doesn't know. He's been using
  for a few years, trying to quit.
- (Tampa, FL -- 11:55 PM Suspicious Vehicle) District 2 -- Cpl Todd Lunge talks
  about a call he once took for a domestic with several brothers having a
  party. One had a bat and he screamed, threw the bat down, it hit the ground,
  bounced back up and hit him in the head knocking him out, so he was easy to
  arrest. He spots a red pick up truck parked in a known drug area. He pulls up
  and there is a woman in a designer bowler hat sleeping on the front seat. A
  window is open and a door is unlocked so he opens it and shakes her. She says
  let go, asks what he's doing and says she's fine. He asks if she knows who he
  is. She says an officer of the law and she was sleeping and doesn't know if
  there are drugs in there. A guy was giving her a ride home and she fell
  asleep. Todd spots a Brillo pad and she says nothing in the truck is hers
  even though there's a pocketbook with woman's clothes and gold shoes. She
  says it's not hers. Backup arrives and he says it's Signal 10 and puts her in
  the back of his car. The guy she was with is a black guy with a mustache and
  no name. In the bag he finds a prescription bottle with her name on it and
  cocaine inside. He also finds a crack pipe. Todd goes back and reads her
  rights. The truck is stolen and she says the prescription is not hers and she
  doesn't have a crack pipe. He says right, he has it now and he'll dump her
  clothes since they aren't hers. They can't prove she stole the truck, so
  she'll get trespassing.

  says they need to see them face to face and are determined to do that. She
  says they just argued, didn't hit each other and she won't open the door

  obligated by law to investigate and if they left and she got hurt later it
  would be the police's fault. The guy says they went to the lake and came back
  home, then had to go back because she forgot her pants with her money inside

Scott drops stuff and is taken out for a drunk test, standing on one foot then goes back in the car. Adam says he's known her for three months, but doesn't know her name. He doesn't know Scott is a man. They don't believe his story and know they just met. They show him Scott's license listing him as a male. He says, "Oh wow!" They ask if he wants a cab because he could've gotten robbed or worse, but he wants to ride with Scott. Scott gets a failure to yield ticket for $53.

He applied and that was 12 years ago. An area called Edison is a high drug area and it's hard to catch dealers because of the narrow alleys they run in and hide. He spots a big black guy, Jerome, in an American flag doorag and gives chase. They corner him so he gives up. They cuff him, arrest him. And find crack cocaine nearby. He's got a Jamaican accent and says he ran because he was scared and the drugs aren't his. A guy was fighting with his girlfriend and she put his clothes in the garbage can. He says the drugs aren't his, but he's been arrested for possession before. Rick asks what's up with him tossing the drugs like a football right in front of him. Jerome wants to know what he's being charged with. His story doesn't make sense, if he's in a fight why is he running toward her. He says he ran because he thought his girlfriend called the cops. If you have more than three bags on you it's possession with intent to sell and he has 15 bags on him. He keeps saying it's not his. He knows the game and will probably be back on the streets tomorrow doing the same thing.

  Corporal Pete Enderle says it's satisfying to help someone with a particular
  problem. They thank you, it's genuine from the heart and makes it all worth
  while. That's why you do it -- for the thanks, not for the glory. He knows
  the black male driver Lawrence, has dealt with him before and drives by his
  house. He spots the car, gets out and sees the suspect run inside. He runs
  out the back, Pete chases him and gets tasered. Lawrence has Coolio hair and
  asks what did he do. It's because he hit someone on Niagara and is
  mirandized. He jumped out the window because he saw all the cops and doesn't
  have time for all this. He says a kid ran right into his car, thought he was
  OK and left because they said they were going to mess him up. It turns out he
  didn't have a license or a cell phone and didn't know if the police were
  coming. He didn't think anything was wrong and he really needed a cigarette,
  that's why he climbed out the window, but would've come back. He would've
  only gotten a ticket if he stuck around, now he gets resisting and driving

  have any pot in the car and wasn't smoking it.  He checks her eyes and she's
  stoned. The pipe is next to a bag of cookies and there is a meth pipe too.
  She says there is nothing else that she knows off. He keeps looking and finds
  a speed straw. Deputy Scott Gould backs him up. She admits to him she used it
  a few hours ago. It was her first time in a while. He arrests her to wake her
  up since she has no previous arrests, no job and still lives at home. He
  tells her this stuff will destroy her and she seems like a nice person. She
  cries. (Fox Mistakenly Lists this as Bad Girls! 4)
