# Context

This is a derivative of William "Thrawn" Wolf III's original ["Cops on Fox"
guide](https://copstvfan.github.io/geocities-copsonfox-archive/). Sadly William
[passed away in
2010](https://www.damianofuneralhome.com/obituary/William-WolfIII-1).

Improvements over Thrawn's guide:

- contains multiple corrections (especially officer names)
- contains all new episodes
- allows text selection and copying
- has no ads
- has better design and hosting (free CDN)
- can be collaboratively edited (feel free to contribute!)
- can be cloned using a single command (`git clone`) for easy archival

## Goals

For every episode:

1. List all call descriptions so that people can easily identify episodes (e.g.
   by searching for "4:00 PM Property Theft")
2. List all featured officers so people can easily find all episodes with a
   certain officer.

## Help improve this guide

This is still a work in progress. You can edit this guide via [pull
requests](https://github.com/copsTvFan/cops-episode-guide/pulls) or by just
using the GitHub website (no git knowledge is required). Emails are also
welcome (`copsTvFan` *at* `protonmail.com`), especially if you have VHS tapes
of the show -- I am missing several episodes.
