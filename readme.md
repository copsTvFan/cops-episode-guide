- **Broward County FL 1 Hour Pilot** (Full 90 second theme) Burt
  Lancaster - This program was filmed during a one-week period with the
  Broward County Sheriff's Department in Florida.  All Suspects are presumed
  innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.  Sheriff Nick Navarro says
  it’s a unique area - to the east of them they have the Atlantic, to the
  west a big swamp called the Everglades. Because of the fact they have a
  labyrinth of waterways it makes the place very appealing to drug smugglers.
  That’s where they face them on a daily basis. He goes with a SWAT team to a
  crack house, smashing the door and running in. One asks for a sledgehammer,
  they break a door, a man is down.  Watch it you guys, talk to me, back room
  is clear, double check them.  Bathroom is clear. A woman is down in the
  kitchen. Nick says it’s one of the most disgusting sights, the garage is
  another bedroom where they sleep. There is the crack altar where they smoke
  it, paraphernalia where they smoke, down here is the toilet on the floor.
  It’s a bucket. This is a typical crack house, that’s why the close them
  down. He is driving and hears on the radio about another officer taken down
  in the line duty by shooting. He says it always happens to someone else,
  not to you, can tell you one thing, he’s been to too many funerals already.
  He’s had more cops killed in FL in 1987 than the state of NY.  That’s a
  tradition. He goes to the officer's funeral. There is a fire by his house
  on the way home. Nick goes home, asks his wife to get off the phone to call
  in about it. She hangs up. He asks about any flammables there, any
  potential of spread. If you see any potential please let him know and he’ll
  head down. He hangs up, he’s sorry, what a way to come home, that’s the way
  it’s been all day, another beautiful day. On the TV news they say it’s the
  worst fire in the everglades, it’s a chemical plant in the Port. Don from

  hide inside the back of an an El Camino. Sgt.  Robert Deak says the dogs will
  jump out and get them, can fill the truck up with drug buys. Dealers learn
  what the tactics are - never sell to a van or car with two people in it so
  they have to come up with new ideas. A black guy comes up and sells a rock
  for $10 and wants to sell another $10. They jump out of the box and get him.
  They go to a second stop and grab another black dealer. The driver jokingly

  likes it because of the people, they are great. The Lt. stops a car. The
  woman says she was looking for the ocean. They find drugs in the car - a
  cocaine rock.  She says it isn't hers, she just wanted to go home. They ask
  how it got there. She says a guy she stopped for directions must have thrown
  it in there. Then asks if they planted it. They cuff her and put her in the
  back of a car. She wants the cuffs off.  The Lt. says to calm down. She
  won't.  He says she is going to the station and is going to be booked. If she
  didn't do it, tell the judge and if he believes it she'll be free. He reads
  her rights from a card. She can't believe he has a card. At the station they
  book her. He is really nice to her about it. She says again and again she
  can't believe there was a rock in the car and is totally embarrassed.  Deputy

  she doesn't want to stay there since she is scared of him and is only 7
  years old. He is arrested and wants the girlfriend to call his mom. Linda
  talks to the 7 year old and says he got drunk and almost hit her.  She
  wants him to stay in jail first for 2 nights, then 4 nights, 10 nights -

  can't come back again. She says he is a good man when he isn't on drugs,
  cocaine or whatever. Linda says she needs to make up her mind, but will
  take the children if she doesn't provide a safe environment for them. Linda
  leaves and the girl wants to go with her.  She promises to come back
  tonight and tomorrow. Linda wants to take her out of the house, but most

16, she lives with her grandma on Johnson street or lives in a hotel. She was
arrested for prostitution 2 weeks ago. He asks what is she doing for money now.
She says don’t ask, she gets it from people she knows. What does she do? They

jail. You tell them over and over to stop, but they never do, they need to get
money. (7:10 PM Wednesday) Street Patrol District 9 - Jim talks to Kelly's mom

Kelly, worried about herself, going to jail and it’s not fun. (10:00 PM

he’s giving her a ride. He asks him why he’s parked there. He says he wasn’t,
then he says he was going across to the store to get furniture. Susan says she
met him last night. He says he stopped and she jumped in the car. She’s
freaking out, says she has to go to court for CPS for Kelly tomorrow for
resisting arrest. He says he can charge her with loitering right now. He tells
the man she’s probably going to jail, he needs to drive off and go home and not
be seen picking up girls. He tells Susan he’s got her red handed and she has to
go to court for her daughter tomorrow for the same thing as she is. She needs

in 5 days. He recommends her begging for the program to take her back. (8:30 PM

didn’t show up in court today. It shows the judge there is nothing there. She

conscience, her conscience is clear. She’s done everything she could for Kelly,
she’s been doing this since she was 12. (Warrant Briefing) Drug Task Force –

use it. They tell him Kathy can go down too and take him outside. She’s scared
to tell him, John is her boyfriend/fiancé, whatever. She doesn’t know why she
should tell how long he’s selling. Her parents are in Florida, they won’t be
happy about it. Rob says she’s nice, but John is an idiot. He’s on probation

in front of large pictures of Marx and hold up pictures of Lenin. (Drunk Tank

English who says they took her jewelry, including a ring her father gave her
when she was 16, now she is 30. It can’t be replaced. She wants to buy
furniture, what she has is 40 years old. She lifts the mattress to show the bed
has holes. She had 800 rubles, they took it all, now she has nothing. There is
a small girl playing in the room. The people have nothing and can buy nothing.
(7:30 PM Nevsky District) They spot a man wanted by police for smuggling and
want to get him outside of his house so he can’t warn his friends. They walk

tries to stop them. They quickly drive away. She wants to know what he did and
where are they taking him. (8:45 PM Suspects are Detained at Police Station) An

little boy who walks up if he lives there, if his dad is there and if he has a
key. He says he does, he is, but has no key. One cop starts kicking the door
until it’s loosened. They file their way inside. The man says why should he
open the door for them. He didn’t want to, his house is his fortress. They
violated his house. He’s dressed and ready to go. They search the place and
find pills. They crush it and dissolve it in the water. The kid climbs up on
top of a cabinet and pulls down a bag and shows them a bottle of drugs. He’s
known it a long time and has reported it to the police, but they didn’t respond
and never came. At first he didn’t know what his dad was doing. He looked in
the slit of the door and say what they were doing. They were injecting drugs.
His parents have been divorced 7 years and his dad comes with his friends to
turn it into a den of drug addicts. Let him be punished, maybe it is better for
him to serve his sentence, maybe it will reform him and after his sentence,
maybe he’ll speak to him. (Good Friday Mass Leningrad) People in church light

foul play because the body was moved from the scene and put into bed. They talk

leading a procession and lighting candles. Part 2 (Patrol Shift Begins)
Leninksy District - cops are given orders and go out to their cars and bikes as
patriotic music plays. A call comes to car 426 to respond to trade school #16.
(Knife Fight a School) It's between Russian and Azerbaijanian students. Some
boys from the republic were studying in the school and the girls are always the
center of the fights. It's the girl or the nationality. A man says they had a
dance in their disco and he was responsible for the music. Then he saw a fight,
stopped the music, ran over and saw a guy on the right with a cut vein. They
are bandaging him up and people crowd the ambulance. One kid says it's his
friend and he wants to go with him. They ask the man how come he didn't see who
used the knife. He was playing the music and called the ambulance. There were
people running all over. They talk to one kid and ask him to calm down and
what's wrong with him. Why does he have blood on his hands? He just fell down,
right there. His arm is cut with a knife, how did it happen? He goes to show
them, then says let me go, I'm innocent. They take him away and go to the
hospital to check the victim. The room is all stone, like a prison. (Crack Down
on Motorcycle Gangs) People drive fast on bikes at night. One blonde girl poses
for the cameras. The bikes are like Honda scooters. A cop says it was a big
group who wouldn't stop, so they chased them and forced them to stop at the
checkpoint so they could check their IDs. A few didn't have licenses or ID. So
their bikes are taken and they are in trouble. Some are drunk and are checked
out. The fine is 300 rubles, loss of license for 5 years and 2 years at a
correctional labor camp. They ask a man why he ran away from the cops. He felt
like it and the cops are full of crap. They check a woman and she says not to
touch her. They aren't, they just want to see her ID. One girl has a long tail
attached to her helmet. She won't cooperate and they take her away. She had no
license plate or ID. At the station they tell her to put her keys down, but she
won't. They go to take her to jail and she fights them. She wraps her extending
keychain around her arm and refuses to let them have them. She struggles and
they say she won't get away and if they have her keys they are guaranteed she
won't get away. They have her empty her coat and put her in a cell. (Rooftop
Surveillance of Suspicious Cars) Cops climb up stairs and have walkie talkies
so they can report down to the street. Other cops go down. Some stay and use
binoculars. They check on a car that has been parked for 90 minutes. As they
pull up they people put on their lights. They go and ask for their ID. It is a
little blue car with a large Bosch sticker on the front, two big cracks on the
windshield and a woman driver who won't come out. They lock the doors and won't
let them in, it happens often. She drives off and two cops jump on her car
until she stops. They ask her what right does she have to drive with two cops
on her car. She says don't yell at me, she won't give her keys, you have no
right. He says he has every right, she has resisted the police. She is
obligated to show her ID to the police when they ask. She won't come out or
give up her keys, so one cop gets in and makes her drive to the police station.
Then they go to the house of prostitute who picks up men to rob them and serve
her a warrant. There is a man there with no shirt in his underwear who says
he's been working and takes them to the woman sleeping in the back. They tell
her to get up and come with them. She says to film her and thanks them, they
are doing lots of things to people, she is talking the truth, they want to
steal from her and do what they want, either way she is going to jail, she will
tell everything. She is naked and wants to get dressed. The man is proud of a
painting he has by Restnatov of a woman and girls at a table. She combs her
hair and says this is goodbye for good, how can she trust them, it's not
possible, she can't trust anyone. She cries and goes back and gets her jacket
and the cops are very patient. He says they are taking her away and will bring
her back, not to worry. He's so tired, has no job. On the way down in the
elevator she passes out. They say to get her some water, tell her to get on her
feet and help her up, she can walk and take her to the station. She admits what
she has done was not very nice, it was the first time it happened to her, she
is afraid no court will want to hear her case. She had no judgment of her own
caution when she visited a house, stole money and is ashamed to have to look
into the face of the man she stole from. They put her in a dark stone cell.
(2:00 AM Officers Off-Duty) Cops sit and cook huge shishkabobs on an open fire
in a field while one of them sits on a log and plays a small acoustic guitar
and sings Russian songs. They sing along to the second verse: "We may not drive
fancy cars, but you can not get away from us. If you are thinking of committing
a crime you better stay out of our way. If you are thinking of committing a
crime you better stay out of our way." They keep singing as the credits roll.

parents to see if they know what he's up to. Larkin says he's known her six
months, they met in January. He hasn't arrested Sam before, but has given her a

is. John talks to Ron, he says he wants to make it easy, there is no heroin,

where he gets it. He used to get it from Jerry, but he's in Las Vegas, on

sold it before. He's shaking and John says they aren't playing games, answer
the questions and sign the papers. Mike says he'll take them to it and give it
to them. He lost his wife 2 years ago and wants them to tell the kids he's OK.

place. They are going to Mike's house to get the heroin and have him call
Miguel and start the game all over again. (4:15 PM) John says they can take
everything of Mike's - his cars, house, everything. The car doesn’t interest
them though, it doesn't meet their requirements. It's a nice old colonial house
though. Mike limps around, says he lived there 11 years and is going to have to
sell it. He takes him to the safe where the combo is right 3 times to 73. John
opens it and asks, “it won't blow up in my face will it?” There is a bunch of
money, some rocks, not much. Mike calls Jose to make a deal. John says he has
to make a decision to take his kids to a foster home and is it the best things
for the kids? They just lost their mom, maybe they'll take the kids for a
little while to wake him up. John is upset and can't even count the money. It's
a tough call. It's not the normal house of a heroin dealer. John asks Max the
neighbor to watch the children while Mike is in jail for a few hours. (8:09 PM)

everyone secured fast and then search the place. There are a couple Mexican

going to show the flag. They are going to go in and do a normal entry since
they bought drugs there before. They have testimony from CRI and Officer Biles
that he's a belligerent weightlifter type, so they are going to take
appropriate action. Bob will do the back bedroom and he'll follow with a key to
get in whatever is locked. The job when they get upstairs is to grab people.
Bunnell clears the upstairs and they find the old man who is the owner
downstairs who fights them and won't go down. During the struggle his toupee
comes off. There are 4 kids inside. Deputy Jerry Hill reads him the warrant
that they have the right to search. Other officers wait outside to see if
anyone else shows up. One of the kids inside is 16 and says he's visiting.

turning around. Bunnell says it's a lie and he'll take him in. He admits he was
coming to the house to see who was there. The owner inside says he only served
alcohol to his kids. There is alcohol out, but his kids aren't even there. He
says his son is at the doctor. All the kids are 16 and just visiting. He says
he wouldn't if he were them and they shouldn't be there. Jerry says this goes
on every weekend. He says he was just off from work this night, it never
happened before. Outside they pull a man out of a red truck at gunpoint. He's
holding a bag and says it isn't his house. Deputy Lane Sawyer questions him
inside and tells him that giving beer to minors is just as bad as giving them
drugs and the neighborhood parents are upset. The son says he won't let anyone
in from now on. If anyone else buys after tonight they are all going down. At

there as witnesses. She cursed him out and fought with her boyfriend. The
officer knows the woman, they know she has a drug problem. He won't have to go
to court if he needs to avoid a problem. They go to a nearby bar and find the
woman. She's a tiny, skinny skank who denies making threats. He says the first
person they'll look for is her if they have a problem with him. He says they
are tired of her. She says she's sick of them. He says he's never talked to her
before, but arrested her when she was driving drunk doing 75mph down the road.

arrest her. She goes back in saying it's fine. (10:12 PM Return Call) A

going to have to move. The cop says he'll be out there 5 days a week for the
next 7 years so he'll take care of it. Two female witnesses saw her too, they
say she's dangerous and there are kids around. They find the woman walking down
the road in a red bathing suit and arrest her for attempted arson. She mouths
off and says she'll talk to the judge. They say to also charge her with
reckless endangerment and trespassing to keep her in jail longer. She curses
them out. He asks if she knows how serious this is. She says she isn't going to
start fires and she didn't go over there. She's drunk again and they says
that's the problem. The man wants to know how long she'll stay in jail, he has
to think of his daughters. He wonders if she'll get her drug friends to come
after him. The cop can't guarantee that won't happen, but he's going to arrest
her every time. Bureau of Police. North Precinct Street Patrol - Officer Harry

answer. They question the old white male driver about what happened. He says
she was hitchhiking and needed a ride. She asked him if he was a cop and wanted
him to turn around and go a different way. He said no and wanted her to get out
and she grabbed the keys. Harry says he's been working this area for the last 2
1/2 years and what she does is have them go around back, get their pants off
and her boyfriend jumps out of the bushes with a gun and robs them. (5:10 PM)
He stops and talks to a white girl on the corner. Harry says she has a
different pimp. She says Kevin is the same guy. He's a black guy and he walks
away and pulls his pants off. He says they rode around before with her after
the guy got her pregnant and beat her. She had her chance to get out of the
life, but has come back. He tried to help her and now will arrest her. She says
she is still there because her mom won't take her baby and he doesn't want it.
Harry says he'll take the kid if she stays there. She says she'll prove him
wrong. He says the baby can't make the choice. (5:16 PM) She is walking with
Kevin and he stops him for pulling his pants down before. He says he didn't do
it and doesn't want to go to jail, he was pulling his pants up. He apologizes

his van and apartment. Bob says there is nothing, same as last time, he wants
to talk to his lawyer, then says to go ahead and look. The van is gross,
covered in filth. John says it's 2:30 AM, it took 12 hours and 2 arrests later

out west." (Street Patrol) Portland North Precinct - Officer Becky Wooten takes

bike. Kevin is a young black kid in a Nike soccer shirt who comes walking up.
She cuffs him, says he's going to jail and he cries. She mirandizes him and
puts him in the back of the police car until he calms down. She says she talked
to his mom, she knows. He says Milton told him to take it. He can't take stuff

friend and tells him he doesn't want to hang around with him or go to his house
anymore. They dare each other to steal. Becky says if they hang out together
she’ll arrest them both for whatever crime the one does. Milton asks if he's
going to the judge and he'll be good. Becky says she isn't unarresting him,

asks why was she talking to a man in a car then. She claims it was her
boyfriend and he doesn't buy it. The young girl turns out to be 15 years old
and again says he knows her. He says he talks to 25 girls a night and doesn’t
remember their names unless he arrests them a bunch of time. She curses a few
times so he arrests her. She says her mom is dead and the older one tells her
to shut up. Harry wants to see her shoes and see if the older one has warrants.
She just met her, didn't know she was 15, was with a friend and he can ask her.
The 15 year old tries to get out the other side of his police car and he puts
her back in. The older says she was with a retarded dude and is going to get
him some tacos because he has nothing to eat. He asks if she is going to be
back on the street. She says hell no, it'll take 15 minutes. He checks the 15
year olds’ purse, finds condoms and wants to contact her parents to see if they
know what she's doing out there everyday. He calls for a female officer because
she crawls out of the car, up on the roof, her dress goes up and she curses out
the cameraman for 10 seconds street. She's totally high and it takes a few cops
to calm her down. Harry gives her to a female to transport her to juvenile. She
fights, rolls, struggles, screams, says get off of me and they throw her in the
back of car where she yells at them. Harry can't believe how strong she is.

John Bunnell says they are going to a hotel in the area with Hispanics fresh up
from Mexico they want to get rid of. Special Agent Celeste Cowan is going in
and he tells her to be calm, like she wants to party. Talk if you must, ask for
coca or cheva. If they want to take them somewhere, take off across from the
Bomber. The girls use a red corvette to make the buy as John watches from
across the street hoping they can do this in one shot. The guys see them and
approach and the girls make a buy for $200. It's their second buy of black tar.
It's a lot of dope. They'll follow up tomorrow. (11:16 AM Next Day) John wants
them to flash a lot and has $17,000 cash. He wants them to ask for a pound, but
to pay for half of it now, half later. Don't front the money, it doesn't leave
the car or else they'll be working parking patrol in Butte Montana and they
laugh. Celeste goes up to the house smoking as kids are around. John hopes she
doesn't give the bust signal because he needs to see more of it. She asks to
see a pound. John gets nervous she is going to blow it. The drugs are at the
sister's unit where the little girl is, she's the drug runner. She counts it
out, that's the bust signal. Undercover and uniformed cops pour into the first
unit. John says he won't take the kids if she shows them where the rest of the
dope is. If she won't tell then kids are gone. The woman agrees and leads them
around back and the kids try to go in too. She goes into the room and then acts
like she doesn't know what they want. They explain it’s drugs and guns. John
finds a sack with 10 big bags of black tar, $250,000 - $300,000 worth. John
tells Celeste she did a good job, but he was worried. Sgt. Loren Caddy goes to
a bad accident. Traffic is blocked off everywhere, fire department has the jaws
of life, EMS arrives, life flight takes one off and the second person is dead.
There is also a young girl in the crash., she is 6, going by ambulance. There
were four women in car, the driver is DOA and her feet were pinned under gas
pedals. There is a set of teeth on the dash. A witness says he was behind the
brown Toyota that got hit. It stopped at the stop sign and the second guy
broadsided them doing 50mph. The husband shows up and says it was his wife,
sister in law and two kids. He asks if his wife made it and Loren doesn't want
to tell him. He says he doesn't know…did he see the cars? The 6 year old and 12
year old are OK, they need you more. The 12 year old was taken first, before
they got there, they called, she is OK. They were out garage sale shopping and
found clothes in the car. Loren asks him if he has someone to drive him or
needs a ride. He says he can do it. He's not a doctor, but the guy needs some
help to deal with it. Anything he can do, let him know and gives him his card.
He has a friend in the truck and Loren wants the friend to drive. Jenny's in
one hospital and the other kid is in another hospital. His friend Bud says to
park his truck and he'll take him to the hospital in his truck. They all go to
the hospital with Bud where they tell him his wife was fatally injured in the
accident, it was instant. To encourage the use of seatbelts the husband allowed
the footage in the segment to be shown.

Chris drives as they stand on the car two blocks looking for the kid. Mom says
she has no idea why he's like this. Chris asks if he's on drugs. She says no,
he flipped out ever since his dad went to jail. (9:22 PM) He's still chasing
the kid and wants to arrest him for assault for beating up his mom. They
finally catch him and a bunch of cops grab him. He has a long mullet and says
they are hurting him and calls for his mom. His mom is right there and doesn't
want them to arrest him. Chris yells at her not to call the police if she
doesn't want their help. In jail he says he didn't run, didn't resist arrest
and didn't know he was under arrest. He asks why do they think they were
chasing him. (Neighborhood Dispute) Dennis says his kids saw a boy named Mike
shooting a BB gun last week and then today the window on his truck was shot
out. Chris goes over there and the dad says no one saw him do it. Mike says he
has a BB gun and shoots it in the backyard, not at his house. He might've shot
a tree, it bounced off and broke his window. Dad offered to pay for it and went
to talk to him. The wife says he refused to pay for it and it's not true,
that's why the police are here. He tried to plead with Dennis to pay for it and
he declined. It's the wife. Chris says Mike admitted breaking it and they
should pay. He says he tried. Dennis says he wants them to take the BB gun
away. Chris says they are all nice about it and Mike has probably learned his
lesson. It’s going to be a long, hot summer and they need to get along.

expect drugs and weapons, he might be armed, be careful. They smash the door in
and get two guys and a girl on the floor. James is in the basement. He says he
won't make any moves and has no weapons. Then they find another guy and take
James outside to search him. He gets unauthorized use of a vehicle, two counts
of auto theft and two counts against Stanley. He says they followed him around
a couple days, so why did they allow him to continue, if he was breaking the
law? So they could get him with bigger crimes. He says yes, but he makes it
sound like he encouraged him to break the law. He didn't suggest he break the
laws, he did it on his own. North Precinct Street Patrol - Officer Becky Wooten
goes to a call of a guy with felony warrants running through a lot. She goes
through huge bushes to get to the guy. He's a wild looking black guy with no
shirt, says it's police brutality, it's not cool and to get his mother at 308

and the guy does drugs. (911 Call Domestic Violence) A woman calls that a man
has a deep wound and hangs up. They go into the house since the door is open

all over him and says Willie is her dad. He's about ready to pass out so they
walk him outside and a girl runs by them and the two women flip out. Becky says
he was the ambulance driver. The girl in blue is the daughter, she can't talk
and cries. The one in yellow is the mom, she holds her and tells her she has to

Bumcrot checks around and finds gay video tapes. His friend was worried, called
the realtor, got the key and came in. The say it must be someone he knew
because she can't get in the building. They find his hands are cuffed and they
cut them out. Later an 18 year old is caught in Las Vegas using his credit
card. His Mercedes was stolen along with his wallet. They want them to arrest
him. He says the 23 year old brother was driving the car. (7:20 PM Homicide
Bureau) Detective Mark Cleaves is told the son confessed to his mom, but she
won't say what he told her. He went home with the guy and smoked crack, hopes
he isn't dead and if he is he wants to kill himself. (3:12 AM Garden Grove
Police Briefing) He said he wanted to turn himself in at the Crystal Cathedral
in Vegas. (4:30 AM Suspect Arrested) They go and get him. The pastor says he
came in wanting to give himself up and he did it. The pastor says goodbye to
him and tells him to tell the truth. They were going to go to Reno to get him,
but they are glad he came back and it's over. West Hollywood Sheriff's Station
(Training Evaluation) Deputy Sean Collinsworth talks to Deputy Paul Terrusa
about his second month evaluation. His total score is 2.8, better than last
time, but some areas weren't. His broadcast skills are good, but when answering
the calls he's not listening. He's the closest unit and he doesn't hear it. The
armed robber he took down 2 weeks ago was superb. Uniform and attitude are
excellent, his saving grace. If it wasn't for his attitude he would've shot him
a long time ago. (911 Man with Gun) The suspect was there before and the victim
saw a gun, left and came back. They play a video tape dated 10/19/89 and it
shows the guy coming into the tow yard and when he turns to leave they see the
gun in his back. They wait outside for the guy to come back and they go in with
guns drawn. There are four Asian guys inside and they ask the guy in the white
shirt where the gun is. The other three aren't with him, so they let them out.
Paul checks him out. The guy says it was a pipe, not a gun. He was pissed
because they towed his car. He came out and his car was gone and he looked for
it for an hour. He says he threw the pipe out. Sean wants to look in his van.
He says OK, but it's not his van. A second guy says he has a BB gun in his car.
They find it and it looks like a .45 caliber. The first guy wants to tell his
point of view. Sean says his point is mute. They say a fake gun will get him
killed. LA County - Sheriff's Dept West Hollywood - Deputy Brian Nelson says he
gets a lot of support from his family. They get excited when he gets certain
jobs, but they worry too. He's brought his fiancé out with him to see what he
does. She puts a lot of faith in him and trusts him because he's got good
training. (11:49 PM Assistance Call) A call of 6 male blacks trying to beat up
a transvestite comes in. He instead goes to a call of three men detained.
Joshua is 19 and has a wool hat over his eyes. They want to see if they are the
ones causing trouble. Deputy Brian Hickey is on the scene. His American Express
Card says James. He says that was a card he just found a minute ago and was
going to throw it away. Brian asks him why he would do that and not turn it in.
They call in to find out if it is stolen. He says he didn't use it, but it's a
misdemeanor to have it. They check him to see if he has others. Josh wants to
know if he'll get in trouble for finding it. He says no, you should call it in
or give it to the police. Common sense says he would try to get it back to the
owner. Josh is on probation for second degree robbery, he did his time and is
that going to be a problem? Josh is arrested for receiving stolen property and
they'll contact his probation officer. Another Case solved. Dedicated to the
memory of Deputy Jack Murphy 1954-1988.

Sheriff's Station Special Problems Unit – Deputy Aldo Iturriaga says you know
why we are all out here. The city, the gay and business community asked them to
come out to arrest hustlers because of the crimes associated with them. They’ll
only make right turns and the signal is to put the blinker on. They are going
to do it different then before by using a limo. Inside the signal will be to
pick up the phone and say, "Let's go to the hotel." Deputy Jim Campbell says to
give him time to play the guys as he’ll have to string them along longer than
normal. Aldo says once you do the passby turn your radio off and say, “You are
going to try to go for it.” They have to stay off Santa Monica and use Fountain
until they get something to do it that way. (9:30 PM) Justin walks up asks
what’s going on. He says he’s a man of the world, would you like to see a lot
of it and get in. He does and says he’s from Sicily. Jim says he comes and goes
as he feels as they go on Detroit. He says he’s a working man, charges $60 and
can get anything he wants for that. Jim asks what he likes. Justin likes BJs
and giving it in the ass. He asks if he likes hotels, motels or the back seat
of the car. He says this is good. Jim says he’ll call his driver and they stop,
run out and bust him. Justin asks doesn’t he have to have money to be busted?
The second guy is a young Hispanic who asks Jim if he’s a cop. Jim says does
this look like a cop car. He asks to prove it. How can he prove it? Let him in.
He goes to kiss Jim and he freaks out and the hustler knows he is a cop. He
tries to get out Jim asks is that a game you lay, he’s a man who moves a lot of
money, he doesn’t give kisses, he’s bewildered by it. Do you usually do that,
jumping in the car looking for a kiss? Does he always do that? No. He says he
looks for something quick, not kissing. He says he finds him attractive. Jim
says he hoped he would. He asks about a price and the guy says he’s not
interested and gets out. Jim says to send any of his friends over that might
be. Then he says this guy is good. (11:38 PM) A guy walks up and gets in. he
says he’s Steve and shakes his hand. Jim says he wants to get to the nitty
gritty, time is money, you’ve got places to go and things. What are you
hustling for? He says he gets different amounts like $50. Jim says what does he
get for that. Then a guy comes over to the car and asks if anyone famous is in
there. Jim says one at a time. The guy says he likes to give BJs and he doesn’t
have a hotel to go to. They go north on Orange to Lexiginton. Jim asks about
him. He says he’s 20 and from Ohio. He wanted to come out and get into acting,
but he got strung out on drugs. He wants to save up for AA to get off drugs.
Then he’ll have his pictures done and get an agent. They pull him out and Aldo
says Fred Hennicker says they busted him before. Jim wants the guy who went to
kiss him (11:52 PM) Eric D’Angelo gets in dressed in drag. He is from Mexico
and tired of it. He keeps talking, then cops bust him and he just stares. Jim
says he’s probably a guy. He says he has nothing on him, no weapons, no ID. Do
you have a penis? Yes. (12:15 AM) An old guy gets in, says his name is Snake.
Jim thinks he’s Steve. He asks his first name and he says Clint. He asks if Jim
is heat. He says does it look like it. He says they try anything. Jim asks
what’s on the menu. He says for $50 he’ll do anything but S&M. Jim says
anything for $50. Then he picks up the phone and says it’s not a good spot. The
cops bust him and say he has coke on him, they know him, he’s Earl Jackson, he
was just released from jail an hour ago after doing 6 months. They laugh at him
and tell him to pick another line of work, he’s not good at this. It’s the 14th
time he’s been busted for it. Will he get a bullet, a year this time? It
doesn’t matter, as soon as he gets out he’ll be back doing it again. Beverly
Hills Municipal Court (9:05 AM Two Weeks Later) Deputy Jim Campbell is called
to speak in the case against Earl. His job is for West Hollywood Sheriff’s
Department, been there 24 years. On 10/21/89 he was working a project for male
hustlers. What does that mean? Deputy District Attorney Lisa Hart questions
him. She asks what that mean. He says he picks up makes for sex. She asks if he
was plain clothes, in a limo. Sgt. Powell was the driver. He picked him up on
the corner. He asked him what is he doing and asked to get in. He moved over,
didn’t come in and came around the other side and he told him he surprised him.
He asked if he was out hustling, he’s a businessman. He charges $50 and will do
whatever you want. Chief Medical Officer John H. Clark gets up next. He’s  from
the LA County sheriff’s dept. They ask him about drawing blood for HIV
analysis. He says Mr. Tribble is HIV+. Public Defender Michael Masterson asks
if the test can be assumed from the results alone that the patient has AIDS. He
says that is correct. Can he assume from the Smith Klein test that he will get
AIDS. He can say for certain, but everything they know says it is a great
chance he will get full blown AIDS. Det. Brown is next up. He first saw him in
the West Hollywood jail and interviewed him there. Did AIDS come up? He
initiated it. He told him what happened on the arrest and he asked him if he
had AIDS. He said he knew 6 weeks ago he had AIDS. He asked him why he was
still soliciting if he knew this. He doesn’t care about anyone else and hopes
they will all get it. As a result of the preliminary hearing the suspect was
charged with felony prostitution. The case was later dismissed by a superior
court on a technicality.

says she's in the van. She says her husband, they don't live together. He lives
on passage. She went to his house, buzzed him at the gate and had three bags
for the baby. He didn't have his key, got mad, hit her in the chest and tried
to pull her wedding ring off. David says they'll have to go back since it's the
city of Paramount and get a cop from there. She's working two jobs to take care
of the kid, he's not giving her any help and is being a rudie-poo. She went to
drop the kid off because it's his turn for visitation and she needs to go to
work. They go to the Todds' house and yell to open up or they'll bring the K-9
up. He doesn't answer. David kicks at the door over and over, but the dead bolt
holds it. They yell for Todd to come out. They let Chubby kick it a while.
Eventually they get in and the dog goes through, but they don't find him. The
paramedics are called for her because her arm is swelling up, her ribs might be
broken and she's thrilled. They cart her off and say he's arrestible now. (6:17
PM) They get a call from Todd asking why his door was kicked in so they go back
to his place. There are a few people inside and they ask where Todd Weiss is.
He says he didn't touch his wife, never in his life. They have to go with the
evidence they have and see. Bail is $5,000 since it's a felony if his friends
want to bail him out. They've arrested him for it before. The law is that if

are four of them living there. She has a black eye from mom, wishes she would
go to jail, when is she going to stop drinking? If she wants to prosecute, they
both have injuries so she'll have to make a citizen's arrest, they'll both go
to jail and they'll have to take the kids. Mom went to AA, but Ann says she
can't solve family drinking problems. She asks the girl if she has a place to
go with her kid. Mom says she bit her chest and Ann looks. The little girl is

**Los Angeles, CA 4** (7:45 PM Shooting Call) Sheriff's Dept. Homicide Bureau -
Sgt. Ray Verdugo says they are seeing a lot of homicides, a vast increase. Last
year was a record-breaking year in the entire county and this year they are
ahead of last year. There seems to be an underlying sense of frustration and
anger unleashing real rapidly, people seem to have a shorter fuse and are more
angry about lesser things. The wrong look will kill you. He often sees it as
fame or infamy. If you can't be famous, be infamous - try to assassinate the
president. Be known in your own crowd as the meanest guy or the guy who shot
and killed someone. It's a tragedy. If he had the job and the education maybe
he could give you the answer why. On patrol he says it is a warm, beautiful
night, very comfortable, one of those unfortunate things that brings people to
southern California. There is a murder in the Fireside station on Hopper in
South Central. Detective Dave Castillo and Deputy Tanya Edwards are on scene.
She says the guy and his 6 buddies were dancing and having a ball with their
shirts off. Then 8 guys came up to them and told them to put their shirts back
on which they refused and a fight ensued between all 14 of them. One guy pulled
out a semi-automatic, then another came out. One is DOA and there are 7
injured. The mans body is in the street and they take pictures. His sister ID's
the body. Several witnesses come forward to talk to them including people
involved and hopefully the suspect, but it's a pipe dream. He's an 18-19 year
old youthful looking guy shot dead in the street for no reason. He took off his
shirt, was dancing at a party and someone took offense and shot him dead. It's
ludicrous, but a sign of the times. A guy at the station says the shooter fired
3-4 shots at Marco. Another witness says in Mexico quite often they take a
stand of revenge. If someone kills a good person, they seek revenge to kill
them. He is only 15, but would kill him if he had a gun. A man is killed and a
cousin will hunt them down. They don't judge, but if they apply customs from
another land, this person will get justice if they don't get him first. Some
friend or relative will get him. If he goes back to Mexico, they will kill him.
(2:45 PM) South East County - Sheriff's Station (911 Call Choking Child) Deputy
David Halm takes the call of a baby having a seizure inside a supermarket. An
employee has her, but doesn't know what to do. He takes the girl and puts her
on the ground. Emily is breathing, that's good. He tells her to stay awake,
don't close your eyes. Fire rescue arrives. Her heart is beating, no pupil
reaction and she's been sick. They give her oxygen, the mom is crying and they
tell her to be calm so the girl doesn't see her and freakout. They put her on a
stretcher. (5:20 PM Warrant Briefing) LA County - Detective Armando Rea says
it's a who dunnit case. A man was on his roof and saw a neighbor at 2163
Briarcrest with his power tools that were stolen. (5:35 PM Warrant Served) They
go to the house and pull out two men, a woman and two girls. The girl says her
dad Mike went to a storage yard. In the garage they find a bicycle, weed eater,
two heaters, an American toolbox and Christmas lights that were stolen. The
victim arrives and carts his stuff out never thinking he would get it back. His
grandma gave him the lights. He was in San Diego while his house was being
fumigated and he was robbed. The wife has no idea what's going on, no idea
about any stolen equipment. Then Mike pulls up and she screams like she's being
killed and yells "No!!!" They pull out guns and make him stop. He surrenders
and is cuffed. They got them all, it was a good stop. West Hollywood Sheriff's
Station - Deputy Sean Collinsworth goes to a cleaner during a full moon wearing
a large nose and glasses for Halloween. The cleaning will be ready Friday. He
says the glasses tickle. (12:17 AM Street Patrol) Sean wants to get a picture
of Deputy Paul Terrusa with a guy dressed as a zombie in the street. They both
get pictures with a man as a silver robot. A man as a French maid cleans them.
They get shows by scantily clad women to the delight of the crowd (911 Suicide
Attempt) A guy tried to kill himself. They arrive and a woman says he just went
down…the elevator. She has blood on her arm from him. They go downstairs and
she runs out the door barefoot. They come around the corner to a shirtless,
white long-haired guy who cut his wrist. He has no knife and says he's unhappy.
Sean asks about anything particular. They call the Fire Dept saying he's on
first floor in the back. Sean eats an apple while talking to him and is totally
unphased. The guy has dozens of bracelets on and wants to go home, but they
have to take him to the hospital. He says they have other business and should
leave. He gets a little bit bummed out in life like they all do. (2:20 AM 911
Call Man with a Gun) They go to Jeff who says he overheard on the intercom that
they were coming in from all corners Sean asks Jeff if he's on medication or
under treatment. He says no. They don't see anyone coming at him. He says a
woman walked out of her apartment with her dog. There was a figure in the front
corner of the apartment, he has his left arm up right now. His finger was
pointing at them, he had a gun and they zoomed in on all fours. He heard the
man call in, he said homosexuality had to be stopped at all costs. It was
pretty aggressive. Sean says it all looks normal to him. He says they split
right before they came in a car. There's nothing they can do now, call us again
if you see them.

they are dead face down in the street. He's been working there since 1965 and
this is the worst thing he's ever seen. Sgt. Rey Verdguo arrives and Deputy
Dana Villander explains what happened. Two kids came up, words were exchanged
and the shooting started. A guy and a girl went down outside and were DOA. All
the shots were fired outside. Two Mexicans were hit inside, probably dead, now
removed. The witness was working there behind the counter and couldn't hear
outside, but everyone started leaving and he saw what was happening. The guy
inside said, "Piru" and they asked why he said that. He went outside, was hit,
came back in and fell down. It's a gang fight between B13 and G13 Gardena 13
gangs. Two Mexicans pulled up and they told him they don't bang. They got shot
at and two customers were hit on the way out. (1:56 AM Homicide Bureau)
Detective Jerry Jensen questions Sherry, a black woman with a huge afro. She
was walking out, they were walking in and they bumped into her boy and he asked
what was going on. A guy pulled a gun, he called him blood and that was it, he
had blood in his eyes. She is trying to remember how he looked, he had a baby
face, possibly a thin mustache and thinks she can ID him. Lennox Sheriff's
Station - Rey says this is a definite hit from a guy in the South Los Gang.
(3:12 PM Homicide Investigation) Three out of the four have now died. They went
to the location looking for a Gardena 13 gang member. It's what the one guy
said that caused them to open up. What they do know is to talk to kids
congregating and see what they heard. (Field Investigation) Two guys say Little
Wolfie died and his brother Wolfie went back for justice. They don't know who
this guy is. (4:02 PM Crime Lab) They remove a large slug from the dead black
female. They have two bullets they want analyzed from a Rossi Revolver, Astra,
Colt, or Dan Wesson. (10:11 Monday) They went to the house and retrieved some
guns. (1:25 PM Ballistic Lab) One of the guns is a Wesson. They say the gun has
no prints, but ballisticaly it matches up. They went to the G13 gang and they
said Osvaldo Renrossos AKA Little Wolfie did it in retaliation for his
brother's death. Ignacio Morina was only 13 and was going to join the gang and
idolized Little Wolfie. They got photos and took it to their three witnesses.
The woman ID's him right away and so does another witness. A member of B13 said
that night he saw the shooter. He wasn't going to help him and off the record
he said it was Wolfie. (One Month Later Suspect Arrested) They pulled by his
house, saw his car there, went up to his mother and got him with no problems.
In the station there is a Robocop poster on the wall. Rey tells the guy he has
rights. He says he didn't do it, but knows about it. Rey said they will verify
his story one way of the other and they want to be sure of a murder filing.
It's multiple murders with the death penalty attached. He denies it, but all
the witnesses say he did it. It's him beyond a reasonable doubt. Narcotic
Bureau Temple City Station (8:15 AM Warrant Briefing) Deputy David Busk says
they are looking for the same girl from July, red hair, green eyes with 19 & 20
year old sons who are crazy bikers. The drugs and scales should be right

night. (8:30 AM Warrant Served) They go up to the white adobe house and the
door is open so they don't have to smash it. Penny is still in bed, the sons
are up front. She wants to put her glasses on. There is a shirtless man
fidgeting there. They are cuffed and she says she only has a little bit of
drugs for herself and doesn't sell. They don't believe her since they found
baggies. She is 38, but she looks 45, the speed is aging her fast. The find two
sheriff's patches in the bedroom and they laugh. They ask her why they deal
with meth, why do bikers like it? He wants a quote for his book. She doesn't

Blvd. It’s trailer #2. EMS arrives, but they can’t get in the door. They hear
someone screaming inside. David slams the sliding glass door with his Billy
club and a woman screams. He tells her to open the door, it’s the police and is
someone is having a heart attack. She says she is now. He’s glad the glass
didn’t break. The old white woman says she didn’t call. She was watching TV
until 9pm and went to bed. EMS checks her out, 140/100 blood pressure. She asks
if that’s high. They say considering, it’s pretty good. It seems a kid called
it in, so it was a just cruel joke. She thanks them. (911 Call Drunk and
Disorderly) They stop a white guy in a cowboy hat next to a white car. He says
he has a license and shows it to David’s partner. The guy says he has had
something to drink and thinks about it – a bottle of beer and 3 mixed drinks.
He has a Budweiser shirt and sounds totally drunk. Where is he headed? He’s not
sure, he’s going to his basement apartment around the corner. He says he wasn’t
going to drive. They tell him he better not. He says it won’t happen. He was
inside a fast food place and was drunk. No one saw him drive, he says he wasn’t
driving, so there is nothing they can do. Minutes later they swing around after
getting a call that he drove away. If they find him they’ll arrest him. They
spot his car around the corner swerving down the road. He hits a curb and
stops. Dan told him not to drive. He pulls him out, says he has no weapons and
gives him a field sobriety test. The guy says he doesn’t know if he can, the
ground isn’t level. They take him to a paved lot and have him walk a straight
line, which he can’t do. They arrest him, take him to the station and give him
a breath test. It comes out .202 - double the legal limit. They put him in a
cell. The breath is always lower than the blood would be so he probably has a
.22 or .23. (7:20 AM Warrant Briefing) Antelope Valley Narcotic Bureau – Deputy
Dennis Ingersoll says they want a lightweight meth dealer, male white, 30 years
old and the informant says he carries 9mm. Tony takes the back, Carl takes the
bolt cutters incase the gate is locked. (7:37 AM Warrant Served) They knock and
announce, then bash the door in. There are four people sleeping on the floor of
the living room. Carol says she is going to faint, starts to shake and doesn’t
live there. The guy with her behind the couch gets up and puts his pants on.
Wayne, the owner of the house is cuffed. They have a search warrant. They cuff
the other guy too. One cop finds a bunch of ¼ grams of meth wrapped in papers.
They bring the guy with no shirt into the kitchen. They hear he’s dealing and
he was found sleeping next to it. He says it’s not his. They bring Wayne in the
kitchen and ask where the stash is so they don’t have to tear the house apart.
He says he doesn’t have a stash and doesn’t deal. He’s told an undercover
bought from him personally two days ago. Now he wants to lie to him, he didn’t
just fall of the turnip truck. Wayne says he doesn’t want his house torn up,
but he has no stash. They’ll tear up every inch of the place until they find
it, how are they supposed to trust him? In a woman’s purse they find an 8 ball,
crank and a syringe. The phone rings and Dennis answers it. He says Wayne is
tied up right now. It’s his boss, he’s late for work. He tells him it’s the
sheriff’s department, he’s under arrest. He can come over and secure the house
for him if he wants. He doesn’t. Wayne isn’t coming into work today. Lennox
Sheriff’s Station – Sgt. Robin Sawyer says Detective Holbrook has info that the
Buchannon family ripped off some Columbians on a dope deal and they are going
to even the score. The Buchannon’s are arming themselves with automatic weapons
and will be carrying them when they go out. If they aren’t familiar with the
family talk to Holbrook. (3:29 PM Drive-by Shooting) They leave and head to a
street under construction where a black man in a blue shirt is down and a crowd
is around. The fire department arrives and a woman says he’s her brother,
doesn’t know who shot him or why, he just got home from work. EMS works on him,
gives him oxygen and he’s not happy about getting a needle. They say he was
just shot, a needle is the least of his worries. Deputy Bruce Vallerand talks
to a witness. The guy says it looked like .32s. One was a .38 and the passenger
shot him. They are a couple of drug dealers. The big guy got shot twice, the
skinny guy shot once, neither are going to die, but it’s definitely gang

says you’ll shoot me. The guy says he wanted to buy a hat, he told her it was
$10 and got mad. They talk to the black guy. He says he didn’t want any
trouble, he just wanted to change the hat. He goes to Cal State, bought a bunch
of stuff, went to wear the hat to the basketball game, took it out and saw it
was all worn. He came to get his money back and she said no, it’s been worn.
The cop says to give him another hat and they can all leave. They want to give
him the money back, but he doesn’t want it, he wants the Chicago Bulls hat.
They pull it down from a display and he says it’s fine. Robin says they come
over to this country and try to make a living. The only way they can survive it
to keep it open 20 hours a day from 6am to 2am. There was a communication
breakdown and they think they are getting ripped off, it’s a couple hours pay
to them. To us it’s not big deal.

and carries a mean looking sawed off shotgun. He carries it for two reasons -
drug rip-offs and cops. He has a floor plan of his house drawn on a chalk
board. John is the ram man, Bobby is the #2 man. If a shooting occurs the
paramedics can take him wherever. If they get hit they’ll got to Kaiser. Sgt.
Art Reddy listens. He’s kinda wired, so be careful (10:03 AM Warrant Served)
The front gated door is open so they run right in yelling, “Freeze or I’ll kill
you!” They hear someone go out the back and give chase. There is a storage
building in the back that is open and they check it. There is a lot of garbage
in the back and a large brick wall he might've jumped. They find the sawed off
fully loaded in the closet. They like the gun and it has lots of shells. They
also find a bunch of aerosol cans including one Fix a Flat that they unscrew
the bottom off and it’s full of three bags of coke. They saw the same thing at
their last raid, he’ll be hurting missing all those drugs. The woman there
isn’t very helpful. She says she’s the aunt and is afraid because her three
year old nephew is with him. (11:22 AM) They cuff her and take her with them to
point out where he is. They find him in a small car with two other guys, make a
felony stop and cuff him, same with the other two. Then the kid comes out of
the car crying and runs to the woman. Caesar in the back is from Mission Hills.
They get their paperwork together and go to book him whistling, “Hi Ho Hi Ho.”
(12:10 AM Roll Call) West Hollywood – Sheriff’s Station. Steve says the way to
the future is community oriented police. Deputy Sean Collinsworth agrees and
they’ll use that as a ruse so they won’t go to jail. Two people were walking
their dogs and saw the public forum and decided to drop in. They heard several
people in the yard and saw the police and K-9s in their yard and asked what’s
going on and they yell at them to stay inside and shut the damn door. Deputy
Paul Terrusa says he’s been there before yelling in the heat of the moment and
later he goes and apologizes. Sean says that’s all they want, it’s amazing how
far “sorry” goes, so they wouldn’t be at the meeting. (1:20 AM Traffic Stop)
Sean tells the driver to turn the car off and get out. The driver gets out and
is very drunk, he doesn’t listen well and won’t interlace his fingers. He says
he had only two beers. Sean takes him over for a field sobriety test. He has
trouble closing his eyes and putting his head back. Then he has him count and
lift one foot and he can’t do that. Sean asks if he has any medical problems.
He tries the other foot and can’t lift it for more than a second. He says it’s
the first time he’s done this. Sean then demonstrates the heel to toe straight
line and he messes up the count. The guy says he’s the cop, he can let him do
it over. The guy can’t even put his heels together. Sean says he passed the
last test, he’s under arrest and cuffs him. They find a huge machete in the car
and the guy wants it, but they say no. The passenger is also drunk and Sean
tells him to start walking home. He keeps mouthing off, says he knows his
rights and wants to know where his friend is going. They keep telling him to
take off, but he won’t listen, so they cuff him. (7:20 PM 911 Call Shooting)

hit someone, the other guy stopped, he crawled out the passenger side and was
rolling on the ground saying he was shot. There is a bullet hole through the
windshield. The side is covered in blood, no witnesses, nothing else they know.
It’s a head wound, Cruz and Jeff can handle it, they’ll go to the hospital. He
looks too old to be a gang member (8:12 PM) They arrive at the hospital, he was
hit twice, once in the head and the bullet is still in the skull. They show the
x-rays. The victim says he was driving east on Rosecrantz, he heard a shot and

OK. They picked up his wife and child and brought them. She comes in to see him
and is hysterical. Sgt. Cole Hughes arrives. He’s not a gang member, not
involved in drugs, it’s just a freak thing, he’s a lucky man to survive.

spread out. There are a bunch of sheds and camper tops from trailers and they
find a guy and a woman in a wooden box. Another guy comes out and they give her
the warrant to search the place. There is a sign that reads “Attack cat on
duty.” The only way to get into their "house" is a wooden corridor connecting
the trailers that is filled with trash. The woman gets up and they make her sit
down, she says it's probably her husband's brother and her son Mike beat her
up. They say it is such a mess that they want her to show them where the drugs
are. He can't go back in there because it smells so bad, the worst he's ever
found. They find bags, boxes and cups full of drugs. She says she's tried to
clean it, but only has one day off a week. There is garbage and boxes piled up

Station - Deputy Sean Collingsworth finds a group of people surrounding a man
on the ground with bandages. A woman says has 25 witnesses who saw a man jump
the guy and beat him up. They say his girl went in the club with his ticket and
he went to get her and they jumped him. A guy pushes his way up and Sean cuffs
him. A guy in a big hat and fringe jacket says Red threw the first punch and
he's the one they cuffed. Sean calls for backup and says it was the bouncers
who did this, the second one is inside. Fire rescue arrives. The guy is totally
bloody and they beat him when he was down. Sean looks for people to go inside
to ID the other guy. The victim says they kicked him in the face and he can
barely keep his head up. They ask him where it hurts, he says his head. People
cheer when they bring the other guy out in cuffs. The bouncers stopped the guy
from going in and the manager is the one who started kicking. The Sgt. says the
manager is responsible. The witnesses say he only kicked him once. They pull
Red out and ask him what happened. He says the victim was thrown out and he
came back in looking for his girlfriend. He told him to leave and they fought.
He held him down and they victim tried to kick and punch him and the other
guys. He hit him and didn't see anyone kick him. So he is arrested too.

**Los Angeles, CA 9** (7:58 PM Suspicious Person) LA County, Malibu Sheriff's
Station - Deputy Gary Spencer says Malibu is different than lots of locations
because of the greater distance, sometimes it takes more than 15 minutes to get
to a call. People are people whether they are criminals or car thieves, it
doesn't matter where you work, there's law enforcement to be done. He stops a
car and Brian the driver says he's never been arrested before. Gary says he has
two kinds of weed on him. Deputy Daniel McCann tells him he's in trouble and he
swears it's not his and can show the keys. (10:50 PM Drug Investigation) They
have Brian call in to make a deal with his buyer. (11:27 PM) They have him,
it's Saturday night, time to go to jail. The dealer is an obese white guy with
a mullet in a fancy white pickup truck. He's so big they need 2 handcuffs and
might even need 3. They find a wad of cash and high quality cocaine off a kilo
brick. The size and type leads them to believe he is a dealer and they write up
a search warrant, present it to Judge Lawrence Mira and go to his house. (1:45
AM) They arrive at the judge's house, he signs it and Gary swears on it. (2:40
AM Warrant Served) They bang on the door and get no answer, so they kick it in.
They find an ounce of coke in the closet, a shotgun and shells in the bedroom.

(4:40 PM Roll Call) South East County Sheriff's Station - The captain says for
shoplifting if they are going for a felony to file burglary and theft with a
prior and they can get them for 16 months on a first offense. Let them know
they are going to state prison so they won't go out and rip off cars. Deputy
David Halm listens. (5:40 PM Traffic Stop) David spots a car with no
registration. He pulls out Robert the driver who knows his headlights are out.
He says he has no guns or drugs, he just forgot to put the lights on. He wasn't
putting anything under the seat where they saw him digging, but they find a
pellet gun there. He likes to target shoot. They find black face makeup in the
trunk. He says it's from Halloween, he doesn't clean his car out much. Dave
asks if he's doing any robbery. He says no, but has been in jail seven times.
He was arrested for meth, but hasn't done it since the last time he was in
jail. He has a massive key ring with hotel keys. He says he just picked them up
and collects them. He claims he owned seven cars at one time, but there is more
than seven sets of keys. They had a robbery a couple weeks ago by a man in
black face. They don't know all the details, so they'll take him in to run him.
He claims the makeup is for his kids' costume. (7:15 PM Robbery Investigation)
They go to the supermarket that was robbed a couple weeks ago. They find a
bagger who was there that night. He said the guy had a painted face and a gun.
He didn't see the gun and he also had a fake beard. A woman says he showed the
gun in his jacket. It sounds like their suspect so they go back to the station
and read the report. The guy left on foot, was wearing makeup, possibly a white
male. They are going to book him for robbery. (8:11 PM Multiple Shooting) They
are looking for suspects wearing masks who had AK-47s. They picked the suspects
out and executed them. David pulls up to a body shop and there is blood and
guts on the street. Deputy Eric Stewart was first on the scene. One guys' leg
was blown off, another guy was shot in the gut and his intestines came out.
Deputy Fred Bertsche talks to one guy. They were watching Star Search, working
on their cars, putting a radio in and then the shooting started and he split.
EMS comes in and treats people. EMS says the first guy was across the street
with an ankle wound, two guys were by the Pepsi machine with one with a head
wound and the other was eviscerated, a guy was by the car with his stomach shot
open and the fifth victim got over the fence and cut his foot open. Sgt. Cole
Hughes says they chased the people through the parking lot and fired at them.
They found a 308 shell, a large round. A woman was on the phone calling the
police and heard someone yell, "Where's the money? Get on the floor!" One had a
red rag in their pocket so it seems gang related. They had a gang shooting two
weeks ago where kids shot at cops with AK-47s. They think they know where the
guys are. It's ironic that up on the wall is a Crimestoppers security alarms
sign. They install them in cars, but not on their own door.

to get there, 5-10 minutes. It’s a possible 5150. The man rang the bell, makes
loud complaints and curses. They spot the guy walking with a red bag and they
go out to talk to him and he fights so three cops jump him and hold him against
the car and cuff him. He says, "Ow! Ow! My little animals, there are little
animals in the red case. They look dead, but they're alive. Ow! Ow! Ow! I am a
cripblood, I am a god." They laugh at him. He has a long coat, white scarf,
orange shirt and a brown turtleneck. He screams they are hurting him so bad,
his animals are alive, don't let them take his butterfly and little hummingbird
by these pig bastards. He swears to god. He can remain silent, they would
prefer it. The butterfly has a number on it's wing “Mail to entomology, natural
history museum, Los Angeles, CA.” Gary tells him they look like they are doing
a good job of playing dead. His name is Robert and he's on medication. What
kind? Anything he wants. His lawyer's name is ouch. They transport him to the
hospital for a 72 hour mental evaluation since he is a danger to himself. (6:10

Collingsworth says 93 to 95 Tom1 he's taking over the call. Deputy Jeffrey Fine
is on the scene. He's training a rookie partner, Deputy Paul Terrusa, so he
wants him to take it. Jeff had them all get outside calmly, the fire is
contained to the east side of the building and is almost out. Paul talks to the
man who runs the building. He thinks it's electrical from the kitchen. He needs
to fill it out like a 39. The fire department talks to one of the female
workers who says one of the shelves with the cookbooks was on fire. She thought
they could put it out, but it just erupted. She takes them into the burned out
room to point out the books that were stacked up and on fire. They are to call
immediately to say it's possible arson. (7:40 PM Narcotics Investigation) They
look for a black guy named Tree and find him on the street. Paul checks and
cuffs him. Sean finds some little baggies on him and the suspect says he
collects stamps and that's what they're for, also for jewelry. There is meth in
the bags, but he says he just found them. He's arrested for a 2020. (8:50 PM)

dealer. He says he's used and shows his arms. They find a bag taped to the
inside of his shirt that has speed baggies in it. This is what they expected.
(1:50 AM) Sean says this is Paul's last evaluation. He's rated competent. He's
made lots of improvements with codes, rules and procedures, it's his first 3.0,
tremendous improvement in all facets of his training. Field performance is
excellent, it's good because he's coming inside next month as the watch deputy
so he'll be watching him. Congratulations and best of luck. (4:31 PM Patrol
Stop) Lennox Sheriff's Station - Sgt. Robin Sawyer tries to stay out there and
monitor all the calls for service and make sure they are answered in a
reasonable amount of time. He waits for the hot calls and rolls on those,
evaluates the deputies on performance and doesn't want them to take unnecessary
risks. Out there they do a real good job, everybody enjoys working there. He
stops and talks to prostitute who has been beat, robbed and shot. She says no
one's done that. He asks if they don't pay is it rape. She says no, she always
discusses payments in advance. She's on a crutch and her left foot is in a
cast. They shot her and robbed her of $1100, then the next time they took $400.
She didn't know she was shot, she heard that a bullet wound doesn't hurt, but
it hurt. There was a hole in her shoe, it went through the first and second
toe, went up and broke it in 3 pieces. She's got someone to rough him up. She
won't call the cops because the girls will beat him up. He says let them take
care of it. She says they hate her. He asks her if she wants to get off the
street. She says yeah, but how? He says to work with him and arrest this guy,
get the SOB off the street. She says to talk to her tomorrow. She's going home
to change because no one will pick her up since she looks like she's
handicapped. They just won't do the right thing. Robin went to his 30th high
school reunion and everything's changed. They took all the trophies out of the
display case and replaced them with tributes to the murdered students. (8:01 PM

with a gun. He says he doesn't have a gun, but they saw him throw it. He's in
7th grade. They ask him his homeroom teacher's name, but he doesn't know since
he just got there. They ask his old homeroom teacher's name and he doesn't know
that either. They find cocaine in a wrapped up paper. That way they can drop it
and no one will know. They are $20 rocks. They saw him toss the gun into the
bushes when he pulled up. There are three kids getting into guns and drugs and

**Los Angeles CA 12** (11:20 AM Saturday) LA County Sheriff's Department
Homicide Investigation - George calls the police to say his wife is lying on
the floor it looks like someone broke into his house and stabbed her. He didn't
check the body to see if she's breathing. The dispatcher tells him to check.
She's dead in a large pool of blood. He called into Lakewood Station at 8:33am,
said he woke up and found her. Lt. Joe Brown investigates, talks on the phone
and has a theory about it. They check the closets and the fridge, but there is
no alcohol in the house. They talk to the neighbor. He's known them for years,
they have no problems and he saw them a few days ago to pay the rent. He has no
idea why someone would want to kill her. They check the stab wound and see it
was a large wound that must've been 12 inch knife. They roll her over and to
take pictures. They load the body up and the blood is leaking through the
sheets. They find the murder weapon and there is nothing stolen, nothing
ransacked. The husband was home when they got there. They are going to talk to
the husband and stepson at the station. (2:38 PM Homicide Bureau) They ask
George his story. He usually sleeps late, but he woke up early. She was already
up, so he decided to get up. He's slow to get dressed and took five minutes. He
opened up the door and she was lying there in a pool of blood. They say there
is a problem, something happened this morning. They all know he murdered his
wife and he can't face up to the fact that he did it. Something happened to
make him mad. How did the blood get on the top of his shoes? He says he doesn't
know what it was, it was there for days. He thought it was her paint or
Crayolas. (4:46 PM Homicide Bureau) They ask if he washed his hands after
finding her. They take samples from between his fingers to see if he has blood
stains. If it's positive it'll change to purple or pink and it won't matter if
he washed his hands. His hands are very sweaty and he says it's from his
medication. She continues to swab his hands. It's not a specific blood test,
it's presumptive to allow them to investigate further. They pull out his shoes
that have red on them as well as hair and possible brain matter. They talk to
the stepson and ask if George is capable of harming his mother. He doesn't
know, she met him when he was 5 and he's 18 now. He's never seen him get mad,
he raised his voice once in a great while and he's a soft mellow person. He
wants to know if someone else besides George stabbed her. They don't know. He
wants to know where she is. They say at the coroner's office. (1:10 PM Tuesday)
Crime Lab - It turns out she wasn't stabbed, she was shot in the back of the
head and it shattered. They want the shoe analyzed for brain matter. He told
them that he approached he wife from behind between her legs and touched her
from the back, but the pool of blood was by her head. She analyzes the Reebok
tennis shoe in a lab. There was no exit wound. She puts the shoe on a
microscope and they wonder about the power. She says the red is clear like
strawberry jam, certainly not blood. His story is going to stand, maybe she let
someone in. They'll have to get prints from the knife, maybe she stabbed the
suspect and he stabbed her. She brought a knife to a gunfight. (2:30 PM Friday)
There are no prints on the knife and no motive for the husband. It could've
been a rapist or an opportunist. George says when he went to call 911 the phone
was unplugged. He had to plug it back in. It's always plugged in because he has
a recorder for the rental properties he owns. Maybe someone got in with a phone
company uniform. Temple City Sheriff's Station (911 Call Assault with a Deadly
Weapon) A woman calls about an attack from a man in a green Jeep with a white
top. He just got on the freeway and they go to look for it. They spot a pickup
truck heading west with a bunch of junk in the back with a tarp over it. There
are three people in the truck, one child. It's heavy traffic so they can't make
a stop. (5:11 PM Felony Stop) They pull him over on Rosemeade Blvd. He's an
older Mexican guy in a cowboy hat. They pull him out at gunpoint and tell him
it's not a joke. Then they call the younger Mexican guy out and tell him to put
his hands out the window, but he doesn't listen. The white male passenger tries
to get out to, and they yell at him to get back in. He finally gets out and is
filthy. The suspect is Jessie Barber wanted in the murder of George's wife, but
this guy's not the one. Deputy Patrick Martinez says to cut them loose and
explain what happened. Deputy Ann Brannon has to explain. There was a serious
crime down the street that matched the description. He thought he was the one
blasting the radio in front of him. They just did an excavation site and scared
the crap out of them. They let them go.

Stanek says he has a 300 rifle, 3-4 shotguns with ammo, a German Luger, 38 & 45
revolver and a 25 automatic according to his son. Two weeks ago he called in
for a report and they took him to detox instead of taking a report so he’s mad
at the cops. They get a call of an attic. Cops back up with blast shield, they
run behind a car, stay low. They hide behind a car, want to get close to shoot
gas and others wait next door at 4800. They want to negotiate, get him on the
phone, if he won’t answer they’ll throw in a phone. Anything to talk him out,
gas is the last chance, no turning back then. Sgt. Robert Gretton explains
about the phone they are throwing in that will go back to the team directly to
negotiate with them. The team goes up heavily armed with a shield, one smashes
the window with a crowbar and the next tosses the phone in a bag. They call at
4:44 PM that it is in. They beep it from the station and Larry calls for him to
pick up. Outside they call in to pick up the phone. Larry wants to help, tells
him open it up and pick it up. He picks up. He doesn’t blame him, they are both
sick of listening to the beeper, what’s going on? He can hear him. Then he
hangs up. (6:25 PM) He said he’s sick of the beeping and cut the line. Officer
Dave Mattson is outside in camo gear. They want cold beers, fresh women and a
pizza. Larry calls again. Sgt. John Hennessy says to be very authoritative,
this is what they want him to do, no more playing around, for his own good.
(8:08 PM) Larry tells him he has to talk to him. Ken says he had to tend to his
dog’s foot and put peroxide on it. What’s all the yelling about? They want to
talk to him. He says they like to hear themselves talk it’s so loud. Larry says
it’s been an hour and half since he talked to him. People are going to react to
him. What is it going to take to get him out? He wants Cordell and Ruben
Johnson. He says Cordell is there. He says he’s not. That’s what they tell him,
he can’t come on though. He won’t trust a cop, it’s like trusting Dillinger.
Larry says if he puts Cordell on will he come out. He might. If he does
something for Ken he has to so something for him. The team outside creeps
around to get drinks and come back, knees are killing them and they are
thirsty. They cut his power. He doesn’t give a crap, doesn’t need it. He needs
him to come out, he has people lined up. Are you afraid of getting hurt? He’s
seen those trigger happy sons of bitches in action. Larry says with all the
people and the press around they aren’t going to get trigger happy. He has to
help him though. He promises if he comes out he’ll secure the house and take
the keys to his sister. He says he’ll consider coming out if he can bring his
dog with him. He can’t do that. He’ll turn him over to his son Dustin though
and leave him in the basement. Sgt. Robert Skmora listens. Larry says to put
him down and come back. He says for tactical to get set up. It’s dark now.
(9:39 PM) The plan is for him to come out. He wants to go to the VA. He was in
20 years ago for violence. He wants to see the SOB he talked to last time. Is
he still there? He saw his name on the list. He wants to tell him how full of
crap he is. If he tells him he’ll take him to the VA and they won’t accept him
then what? That’s a different story, he doesn’t know, he won’t have any power
then. They’ll talk to the people later. He wants them to talk now, later is
crap. What else will it take to get him out? They worry about what they’ll do
with him in the future. Dr. Steve Geiger, Psychological Consultant says they
have to worry about that, can’t lie to him. He’ll say I listened to him once,
he won’t again. He has access to lots of weaponry and will in the future. When
he comes out they’ll place him under arrest and clear the house. Ken asks what
does he want him to do. He wants him to walk out with his hands up, stand on
the steps and listen to the officers for what to do. They call the tactical
team that he is ready. He comes out in a dirty blue street and hat. They tell
him to walk to them and turn around, down on his knees, keeps hands up, then
lay on his stomach. Two guys go over and cuff him. They are worried about other
people inside, but he says there is no one. They take him to the car. He says
again he’s alone. Officer Riley Gilchrist comes over to Larry and shakes his
hand and hugs him, good work. Ken got pissed that they were yelling at him
outside and he came to the phone. Inside they show the two bullet holes in the
door. There is a 30-30 on the couch. He had a gas mask next to him, he was
prepared. He has a semi automatic, lots of riles and ammo there. It would’ve
been a hell of a battle. The place is a mess and there are pill bottles all
over the tables. Chief John Laux arrives and tells them it’s recorded for
posterity and will show they take a backseat to nobody, they are the best they
proved it again tonight, nice job. The suspect was charges with second degree
assault and released on bail the following day.

**Minneapolis, MN 2 - Rookies** (Police Academy Survival Training Exercise)
Cadet Mike Looney says to get out of the car with his hands in the air. He
wanted to be a cop since he was a kid, maybe he's naïve ,but the fact you can
help people is a noble position to be in. Officer Wes Edstrom supervises as he
gets out of the car at gunpoint, cuffs and searches a guy. Mike is told to keep
the back door open while searching them and put their feet back and head on the
trunk to keep them off balance. When you go down to search don't go on your
knees or they can kick you. It's looks good. (Practical Exercises Lab) Sgt.
Dave Martenz draws on a board about the training, they can film them from all
angles. They can see if they have it or not, how they treat people, if they
have a bad attitude. He's not looking to scare them or drum them out, he wants
it to be a positive experience. They are going to a bar scenario. The actors
are real cops using lines they've all heard in the bars. Dave says he's heard
it over 12 years while he watching, it's real interesting. The bartender says
he's having trouble with drunk customers and wants them out. They try to talk
to them and say why do they have to leave. It's their bar, they want them out.
One woman fights and they throw them out. Then they find a gun on one guy and
he claims he has a permit and wants to show it. He tries to get him to put the
gun down as his partner holds him at gunpoint. They hold him back and he fights
because he doesn't like to be restrained. He says he can walk out on his own.
They say OK and the guy runs out. He comes back in with a gun and says for the
cops to let her go or they'll get shot. They both run out. That's two in a row
they screwed up. Dave says if they can't win don't go forward. (Cadet
Graduation) They have to swear in and are official housing patrol cops in a
large ceremony. Mike kisses his gum-chewing wife. (Roll Call) Sgt. Thomas Kerns
reads out the assignment. 510 is Laplant and Zurwas, 520 is Hirsch and Looney.
Mike was top man in his class and got the William Perry award – they are
goofing on him. Talk to the Sgt about it. (8:40 PM) Officer Mike Looney says
it's his first day. (911 Call Street Shooting) A black man in blue jeans, a
blue hat with A on it and a black t-shirt is the shooter. Greg is driving him
on his first day. Tom says she's all yours. They drive around looking for the
guy and finally spot him. Mike holds him at gunpoint, Greg searches him and
says he's sweating like a racehorse. The suspect asks what that means. He's
cuffed and says he matches the description of a shooter. Where was he? He was
at his girlfriend’s, cousin’s house. He turned away because he's scared out the
police, not going to lie. His cousin lives right there at 206. They go back to
the cordoned off scene to ID him. Officer Greg Hirsch says the hat is a Wrigley
field diamond which looks like an A (9:10 PM) The ambulance is working on the
victim with two gun shots in him. A witness with long dreadlocks says he saw
him when he was sitting in front of his house and ID's him. It was a shooting
at a crack house. The suspect was chasing the victim in his car, he hit an
innocent car, crashed into a tree and the guy jumped out and shot him three
times. He has a bunch of rock on him, might be a drug deal gone bad. The
shooter gives him three different stories – he was watching TV with his
girlfriend, then can't remember the show, then wasn't watching TV. (10:31 PM)
The suspect is brought in. Mike says for the first day it feels good, after the
years of college and school, now it starts to pay off. On the first day you
want to catch all the bad guys. (4:35 PM Assistance Call) He says all rookies
get in a mind set like they are going to change the world. One cop told him you
aren't going to change the world, just go out and make your little dent. After
20 years there will be someone behind you to do the same thing. A call of a
confused elderly lady at a downtown store comes in. The woman says she missed
the bus and was short on taxi fare. She's a government worker, on SSI and gets
a check every third work. She's well known and called the police for a ride
because she was always told to call a cop when she was in trouble. So they give
her a ride. (5:20 PM) She says she works and is a good woman who earns a
living. (9:21 PM 911 Call Assault in Progress) They spot a Mike, black guy in a
yellow hat with his shirt falling off and put him in the car. The victim has a
thick Russian accident. He says the guy attacked his friend, came up to him,
was on drugs and took his watch. His friend comes up with a shirt wrapped
around his head, his face is bruised, bloody and he needs stitches. He hit him
with his fists and they ran to the gas station and found a pipe to defend
themselves. Mike says those two guys attacked him and ripped his jacket, he
doesn't know why and he hasn't been drinking. Officer Larry Krebsbach puts him
in the ambulance. Officer Laurie Janikowski finds a watch in Mike's pocket and
asks the victim to describe it. He says it's a cheap gold Rolex and it's
broken, because he broke it. It's a match. (10:08 PM) Out there you are dealing
with average people, good and bad. Arresting a felon, helping an old lady back
home, it's part of the job.

**Minneapolis, MN 3 - Women Cops** (8:13 PM Domestic Disturbance) Third
Precinct - Officer Janee Harteau says the main reason she became a cop because
it was challenging, not a controlled environment, you deal with all kinds of
people from all races and all levels of poverty from rich to poor. It's
different, but everyone's the same. It's easier to talk to people when you are
a female. They were brought up to talk first, physical next. Officer Holly
Keegal has a blonde short puffy mullet and says originally was going to be a
teacher, but took some law courses and really enjoyed it. She took more classes
and decided to pursue law. They go into a backyard and there is a dirty white
guy with a heavily stained shirt sitting there. He says he lives there, looks
drunk and has trouble standing up They lead him around front to search him,
find nothing, put him in the car and he flips out. He curses at them and says
he didn't break any law and won't fully get in. The woman in the house says
he's her brother. He's an alcoholic, one of the nicest guys when sober, but
when drinking you stay away from him. They go back to him and he says "take it
easy, I don't care who you are, what are you trying to do, why don't you stop?"
They want him out so they can cuff him. He struggles, goes down, his shirt
comes up and he tries to roll away when they go to cuff him. Holly puts her
knee on his head. He curses them and says something about them failing
training. Janee says it doesn't matter that they are women, they aren't messing
around. They aren't getting away with it. On their off time we see Janee
playing the drums with black gloves while Holly plays the keyboards in the
garage. Holly took piano lessons for a little while, but gave it up to play
sports. She can't read music, but plays by ear. She wears short pink shorts and
a Guess top. Janee sings, she was in a band, so they got together and thinks
they can really do good some day if they pursue it. It's a great stress
reliever away from the job. (10:03 PM Theft in Progress) A young black kid was
seen running. They pull up and Holly runs out and catches him. She stands on
him and cuffs him. He was on a motorcycle and she brings him to the backup unit
and puts him in the car. She goes back to the Vespa scooter. Sgt. Tom O'Rourke
arrives as their car is making all kinds of noise. Holly explains the screw is
off on the air conditioner. There were four of them, but they only caught him.
He's a juvenile and will be booked for theft. A full jail is a happy jail.
(3:21 AM) 911 Call Residential Robbery - Officer Pam Elius says it's quite a
job, not anyone can do it, no other job is like it. She couldn't do anything
else and wouldn't want to do anything else. Where else could you work 8 hours a
day and have fun? A black man fled a house he robbed with a gun. They go to the
house and the victim is an old woman who is terrified. She was sleeping and the
guy came into her room and covered her mouth, she's worried her mouth is
swollen. Officer Charles Teneyck writes her story down. Pam gets her water. Her
mouth is fat and she tastes blood. He went through her purse, took her keys,
told her he needs money because his kids were hungry. She went to get her purse
and wouldn't turn the light on, but was afraid he would attack her. He came in
the back window, but she only had $1 in there. She didn't hear him, he left out
the back door and gave her the keys back. Pam checks the window and the screen
is cut. She hopes with the info she gave them and the jewelry he stole they can
track down the piece of scum. (4:47 AM Vehicle Fire) They go to a yellow van
that is burning up as fire and black smoke are pouring out of it. They find a
guy nearby and check him out. She moves the car away in case it blows up. She
gets out to talk about blocking traffic and there is an explosion. The Fire
Department arrives. Pam hopes there was no one inside, she called but got no
answer. The guy says he and his girlfriend live in the van and are homeless,
she lit a cigarette and he couldn't get her out. They don't find a body though.
The guy has Tylenol 3 that he says it's for his leg. He talks slow and he’s out
of it. He has chest pains. There’s no label on it the pills because he wanted
to sell them. Pam says there was no girl there, but he says she was. He wants
his pills back, she says to talk to the doctor. He wants to take a leak, she
says only if he wants to go to jail.

McShane and Officer Paul Cottingham go up to the house and say her they don’t
know where it happened, have no suspect info and will take it as they get it.
They walk up to the dirty house and the TV is blaring. Macy the girl says
cousin Randy was going to take her to McDonald's and Freddy would pay for it.
Freddy told her they would go around the corner, he’s someone they know and
trust, a friend of her aunt and he's 35-40. He told them to get in the car so
she got in the back and he told her to come up front. They went to McDonald's
ordered food and he didn't pay for it. He told her to come in his car and sit
up there, she said no, she was going to go to McDonald's and he said no, but
they went anyway. He wanted to go to the movies, she said they couldn’t do that
and he started the car, she wanted to go home, he parked and asked her to show
him something. She says she didn't have anything. Then he said he would show
her something. She said no. Did she know what he was talking about? Yeah, his
private parts. He started driving, almost crashed and she yelled. He put his
hand on her leg and she started crying. He said you are scared huh? Macy and
her mom then cry. It will be molestation and they will turn over to child
welfare. They will get back to her, they take it very serious. Avoid contact
with Freddy, they'll get back to them, it could be something he does often. She
did the right thing by telling her mom, she was very brave, a lot of people
don’t tell, otherwise it could go on. Stay away from him, it's a bad scene.
(Roll Call) Fifth Precinct - Officer Don Bautista says they had an unusual
burglary last night, all he did was go through the woman's underwear, sexual in
nature. She is a counselor from St. Mary's chemical dependencies. He was
discharged on Monday, has called and left her a message on her machine. He
works at a Pizzeria, is a 20 year old white male, they'll talk to him tonight
and see what his story is. All he did was take her underwear out and did what
those type of people do. (7:45 PM Burglary Investigation) They go to Ribizza
looking for Ben, he isn't there, but will be back in 15 minutes. He’s wearing a
white t-shirt and dark shorts. They get him when he pulls up and detain him.
He's curious as to what is going on. There was a burglary on 27th & Xerxes last
night while he was working to someone he's familiar with. He says Tracy is the
only one she knows living there. He has surprised her when she was sunbathing
at home and on the beach. He says he said hello to her at the beach and she was
expecting him at the house. He's been in her house before with her, with her
permission. It's just an interview, so he's let go. He goes to see Tracy. She
says she didn't call Ben and didn't make a date with him. He tells her what Ben
said that she made advances towards him. He knows this is false. There is no
relationship between them. She says "oh, god" about her dating him, he must
have quite a record. He says he has no record and checked around the world. She
asks if he thinks Ben will do something. He can't guarantee that. When she
comes home, open the door, don't go in, wait, listen. Don't go anywhere alone,
bring people with you. The guy is a wacko, you've read the papers. They have
probable cause to arrest him and goes back to Ribizza to look for him. He goes
in and finds him in the back. He is searched, cuffed, taken downtown and
mirandized. (7:17 PM Domestic Violence Call) Third Precinct - Officer John
Billington says it seems whenever you get alcohol and drugs in the picture it
gets worse. Lots more domestics lately, whenever force is used on people living
together they have to make an arrest. Officer Steve Setzer is his partner. They
get a call from a woman saying her husband is smoking crack in the house and
she wants him out. They pull up, she says he's in the bathroom freaking out and
has kids inside and a gun. They don't want to go in and say she should get an
order of protection against him. They go in eventually slowly with guns drawn
and head upstairs. They find Quinn up there, but he goes down the hall on him.
He says he didn't put his hands on nobody, hasn't done anything. They go to
cuff him and he says don't take me please. They are just talking to him. There
are two infants laying on the bed. He says when he got back they really started
arguing. He's breathing heavy, says he's hot, really scared and not on crack.
John changes a diaper on a crying baby. The woman says he spent the whole rent
check on crack, he was swinging things around, she was really scared and he was
foaming at the mouth. They tried to keep him inside until the ambulance came,
but he was slinging them around. Quinn is sweating bullets, says he didn't mean
nobody harm, didn't hurt anyone. She says he needs help. She went to Chicago
with her mom, came back and he sold everything. All of her furniture was gone,
he sold it. They can't find any drugs, so will take him for domestic. He
promises not to do anything and will leave. He says she can get a restraining
order on him, just don't arrest him. They tell her to go to the county, floor
17 and file a OOP on him. He just wanted to take his car and leave. She says he
went out to get pot, he came back, went into the bathroom and she smelled
smoke. He came out, threw her and his sister around. It appeared like he was
smoking crack. The sad part was he checked the diapers not to see if they were
wet, but to see if he shoved the crack in there, he's seen it before. A cop
can't expect he can change the world, but he can make it a little better.

says the Skinheads, Lawyers Guild and Woman against Military Madness will be in
the demonstration at 3:30 PM by the federal building. Expect 300-500 people.
They don't have a parade permit, won't disclose it so they’ll go in private to
discourage and provoke the police. They will provoke by spray painting things.
If cops move in they will throw rocks at them. They will ID the leaders and may
wait until the end before they arrest people. A female cop goes undercover as a
punk goth chick in a black wig with black lipstick. The cops get all their riot
gear ready. A speaker says they have no permit, but will march anyway. A hippy
leader approaches police who will assist them in any way possible. They will
give a police escort, but keep the traffic blockage to a minimum and no
vandalism. The guy says they don't want any trouble, want to march, traffic
support is OK. Their chant is "We're going to beat back the Bush attack" and
"1234 we don't want their bloody war." They put up posters and burn a dummy.
Then things get out of hand and one person is arrested. They tell the leader
they have painted the building twice, vandalized, enough is enough, time to
move along. A couple fights and are arrested. The goal was to wait and
surgically remove the leaders. A guy threw paint bombs and two people jumped
them, all are arrested. (5:05 PM Debriefing) The leader bit an IDS guard and
went to jail. The plain clothes people ID'd him, a job well done. (911 Call

them niggers. Officer John Billington goes to the victim. He's a white guy with
a bunch of cuts and a bloody nose he covers. He says they ran through his yard,
didn't see them, but knows their car. Three black guys tried to break into his
garage, he confronted them, they beat him and took off. His car also has
windows broken out. One of the crooks says he punched him in the face and
pulled a knife on them and they took off. He says there were two of them and
stabbed their windows. One guy keeps yelling and John tells them to speak
English, he's listening, stop the garbage. The guy in a Batman shirt gets loud
and says the guy accused him of going through his yard. They ran and thought
they caught him. The victim says they came through his yard and they beat him
up. The criminals says they left their house, went to their car, the guy yelled
at them, smashed their car and they chased him, but didn't catch them. No one
knows what happened, both are lying and they can't tell who is telling the
truth. They are going to write them up and cut them loose. What about their
car? That's what insurance is for. Fourth Precinct Roll Call - Sgt. Frank
Dallman reads a report about a young black thief who cuts in windows and steals
things, tools and more. Officer Bill Thornberg has been there 15 years, likes

office, he's his own boss, other jobs aren't as flexible, the pay isn't great,
but it's a good job. Officer Chuck Nathan is his partner. (7:48 PPM Fight Call)
A man was hit in the face with a shovel. There is a massive group of people
there when they arrive. The victim is on a lawn and is bloody and squirming. A

back, give him air, it's hot as hell. The victim's ear is split and he needs to
stay down, but keeps trying to move. A crowd stands around, they don't know who
he is, but know the guy who did it though. His name is Terry and the victim is
George. He’s bleeding from his arm and ear. EMS arrives, says he's unconscious,
they need to move him fast and holds his head. It's a struggle to move him. A
witness says Terry broke a beer bottle and hit him. He pulled out a bunch of
his hair, then they started punching and fighting. He was stabbed 4-5 times
with bottle, split ear, cut artery in neck, spurting blood. It wasn't a shovel.
They caught Terry a few blocks away. George's mother holds a bloody rag and

it's an interesting job, he works with 800 people where if he has a problem
with 1 or 2 of them, that goes out the window when you go to back them up.
He'll put his life down for those 800 people even if he's never met them
before. He gets a call of a white woman with a gun at 2919 in the rear in a
yellow shirt. They get out and run through a parking lot with guns drawn. There
is a group of people in the lot and they tell the woman in yellow to get her
hands up and she doesn't listen so someone pushes her forward. She says she
doesn't have a gun, she did, but dropped it behind the car. They find an
automatic handgun back there with no clip. A witness says she's been pointing
the gun around for two hours. The cops came once and she said it was just a
fight and they left and she started it again. Greg loves this job, where else

Dispute) A woman brings her kid over who says his brother's shirt was thrown on
the neighbor's roof and he wanted to get it and the guy told him if he went up
there he'd shoot him. She doesn't really know the neighbor. The neighbor says
he's had a lot of problems with these kids. They take his stuff and damage his
property. He found a kid on his roof, didn't know who was up there and they
wouldn't come down so he told them if they didn't come down he said he would go
get his gun. He admits it was the heat of the moment, a dumb thing to say, but
he was tired because he had a really bad day and took it out on the kids. Greg
says she can follow a criminal complaint on him and goes back and has the guy
apologize so it doesn't have to go any further. It's better they try to get
along, but next time ask the guy before you climb on his garage. (911 Call
Domestic Violence) Officer Bill Thornberg says with domestics you never know
what to expect when you get there. The tradition is a man threatening or
hitting a woman and he goes off to jail, but you never know. Andrea Jones calls
that her boyfriend went off on her, he's on cocaine, she can't control him and
she cries. It is nighttime at house 1530. They walk up and hear gunfire in the
distance. The guy inside says he's drunk again. She says he threatened to kill
her and 911 heard it. He says it's just a threat thing, he does it all the
time, but she denies it. He just came home, accused her of crazy things and
threw her down. Police have been there before and she never pressed charges
because she loved him. She wants him out, wants him arrested and wants to press
charges. All her family is dead except for her sister upstairs and she couldn't
get a hold of her. She said she didn't do anything. Officer Chuck Nathan checks
him for weapons. She says he's been on coke for months and called her a slut.
She was at her sisters, not at bars, found out he was on coke two weeks ago and
called the crisis line, but they don't understand. Bill says no, he hasn't been
out there before and gives her a card with victims rights and domestic violence
info, how to get a restraining order and the number for a battered women's
shelter. She says it's her home and if she leaves he'll follow her. They tell
her to leave the phone off the hook. She doesn't want them to let him out
tonight. Bill says they'll call before they let him out. She says to ask his
mom how abusive he is, but only to her. Third Precinct - Officer Steve Setzer

woman neighbor saying, "I hate those niggers and niggers this." The second
woman says they cut her power and has to have all the smoke detectors wired
together. She's white and was in her house having a private conversation. The
black lady says she could hear it in her kitchen. Officer Cheri Dexter talks to
her, she says she has two witnesses. Cheri says there is nothing they can do,
how are they going to get along, it's between them and the landlord. A black
guy with no shirt appears and says they threw beer at them. She says they
threatened to blow up her house. Steve says for them all to go to bed and
ignore each other. She says she pays $48 a month and it's a nice place. The
white guy is drunk and told the black guy, "…for the niggers to get out of
here." They go back around and tell them to cut the crap and stop yelling. The
white guy says he told him he would get his gun and blow his brains out, is
that right? Cheri says other neighbors are complaining too. She can't stay
there all night, give it up tonight. Steve says it starts to seem like they are
the problem, the guy is a drunk and obnoxious. The guy says he hasn't bothered
anyone. He says maybe he will go to bed, maybe he won't. How dare he call me a
drunk, how do to you know me, you're so tough? Steve says to come on out of his
house. He makes noises at him and says he won't come out because then you'll
arrest me. Steve says he's an obnoxious jerk, but there is no law allowing them
to pull him out of his house and taking him to detox.

**Alaska 1** (State Troopers) Nome - Trooper Ike Lorentz & Sgt. Al Schadle
check the weather, 1000 foot overcast, visibility 15 miles. They are going 180
miles away, should take an hour. There was an assault and more a couple days
ago. They look at the map and go out to top off the gas tank on their small
plane. The state is 560,000 square miles, as big as the US. He'll work a 16
hour day and 10 of it is in the air. His beat is 200,000 square miles, if it's
not the last frontier nothing is. (Village of Savoonga) There is a bootlegging
operation where they make or can buy the alcohol and transport it to a dry
village. This causes problems for at least a week until it dries up. Magistrate
Abner Golorgergen meets them at the tiny airport. They ride in a truck to the
magistrate’s office. Once there they talk to an Eskimo who seems high and
usually isn't like that. There is a makeshift court in the building and they
try the Eskimo man. He shot a rifle outside of a public building and was drunk
in the second judicial district. The highest penalty is $5,000 and a year in
jail. Ike says the man is a danger by the state of his mind and asks that bail
be set in the matter. It is set at $1000. Abner wears sunglasses and jeans and
as soon as he's done he takes the robe off. They have to take the man's
possessions, but he doesn't want them to. He wants to take them home. He says
they have to do it and he is in their possession until they get him back to
Nome. He wanted help, turned himself in and wanted to get out of the village.
They take him out to the airport, get on the plane and fly back. (Hit & Run
Investigation) Anchorage PD - Officer Mark Hunstiger says people joke about the
town. The nice thing about it is you can get to Alaska from there. There are
250,000 people living there, half the state. An island city stuck in a vast
wilderness. They've had five hit & runs in the last 10 minutes by a man in an
Arizona van. He spots the red van in a parking lot with a brown car under the
back end. The guy ran off and witnesses point him across the street. The guy is
behind a building where a woman is keeping her eye on him. He searches him and
asks if he had any beers. He says three. Mark asks him if he had them all at
the same time and he says yes. He admits he only backed over one car because he
didn't see it. He didn't hit anyone else. His DOB is 2/31/59. Mark talks to
witnesses and suddenly the drunk has left his car. He asks if this an escape
and has to go back in the car. He says he will behave if he removes the cuffs.
Mark says they don't make deals with drunks. They go to put him back and he
fights. Two women help and they have to hobble him. He says to go ahead and
arrest him. They agree. They take him back to the station and his BAC is .232.
He says the Fiat parked behind him, it wasn't his fault. He skimmed off a car
at a bar. Which one? The bar where they found him. He wasn't at a bar, he was
at a credit union. He was? Mark says maybe they serve drinks there. The
magistrate can't believe the damage he caused and since the guy only has $50 on
him he won't make bail which is good because he's so dangerous. He can't
believe no one got killed in his rampage. (State Troopers) Pilot Bob Larson is
going to Seward to recover a body from a plane crash that happened three weeks
ago. It is at the 3000 foot level in the mountains. The wreckage broke up bad
the first time they were there when they found four bodies. The site is often
in the clouds and they've been there four times already. Cpl. Jerry Fleetwood
is coordinating the search. Hopefully he'll recover the body and the effects,
ID it by whatever means, then notify the next of kin and get the remains back
to them. A Cessna 207 during an hour flight tour that took people from a cruise
ship hit the side of a mountain. They are supposed to meet climbers there. They
land the helicopter on a mountain and walk over. Two male climbers are heading
down tot he wreckage. Jerry says the best thing about being a trooper is the
gratification from getting the job done. The only good thing there will be is
to bring the remains back to the family. They find the body, load it up in a
bag, move the helicopter and lower a tow rope down to get it. The father of the
dead girl was waiting for her, but had to go back to Florida for medical
reasons. Back at the base Jerry calls the father and says the body is at the
funeral home where is wife is. He hopes that returning her will put it to rest
in his mind.

**Alaska 2** (9:10 AM Drowning Investigation) Bethel State Troopers - Trooper
Terry Asberry and Sgt. Dan Hickman got a call last night that three male youths
were joyriding in a boat, took a sharp turn and the two in the back fell out.
The driver came back and found one guy, but not the other. It'll take an hour
to get there by plane, about 100 miles away. They wheel out a Cessna tri wheel
from a hanger. They says the area looks smooth, but there is a lot of turmoil
under the water, lots of eddies and drownings. Kotlik - they see nothing from
the air. At the airport they meet Safety Officer William Murphy. He says they
just gassed up and they've been using poles to drag both side of the river.
They get a call that they found the victim and go to the wooden jail for a body
bag. They drive a boat out and there are another 10 boats on the scene near
where it happened. They have a foot sticking out of a line. They get into a
second boat and spread out the body bag and pull the body in. They go to the
magistrate to say the kid had no life vest on, if he did he probably would've
lived. (4:58 PM Child Assault Call) Anchorage - Officer Marc Woodward says
Alaska is a very liberal state. The people's rights are utmost so they have to
be extra sharp with constitutional laws so they don't lose a case because of
it. A teenager assaulted a small child and EMS is on the scene. They are in a
field and the kid is screaming. His friend Brian who is 21 says he fed the kid
alcohol because he wanted it. EMS needs to take him to the hospital, the kid
says he had a couple of Coronas. He lives on Jewel Lake and has no phone. A
witness says he saw the kid crawling away and the Brian picked him up and threw
him, then tried to carry him away. He grabbed him and made him put the kid
down. They drive Brian to talk to the parents. The kid says he made them drink.
Brian says he wanted it. He drank some and didn't want anymore and they said to
take it. Marc goes in to talk to the parents. Mom wants to kill Brian and Marc
says he might himself. They do have a phone and call Providence Hospital. In
the hospital the kid screams like crazy when they put a line in his throat with
an IV in. His BAC is .178, would be 7-8 drinks for an adult, less for the kid.
They won't charge Brian until they know more. They give him a citation instead
of going to jail, but he'll have to go to court. The kid seems like a zombie.
Marc says the kid could've died and Brian is stupid. Anytime a kid is in danger
it hits closer to home, especially when you are a parent like he is. (9:20 PM
Shoplifting Call) Anchorage - Officer Scott Jessen says he's originally from
Boise ID and the army sent him up there in January 1979. He likes the country,
it’s familiar. It's the same as Boise except for the snow and ice. They get a
month of decent weather and the rest is snow. A kid stole a $14 book from a
comic store. He tells the kid he is under arrest and asks why is he grinning at
him. He says his dad's here. Scott says it's not a joke and he can take him to
jail even if it's a comic. He says he's never been arrested and never stole
before. He then says he didn’t steal it. He put it in his bag while he was
still shopping. Scott tells him it's concealment. He tells him to sit and he
starts crying. The dad says he's never done it before and had enough cash to
buy it. There is a TMNT poster on the back door where he's sitting. There is an
Archie Comics rack with Super Mario Brothers. Batman and Metallica Harvester of
Sorrow shirts are hanging up. He says he was looking at a computer game and
wanted to get some other stuff. His dad will take him and he has to go to
juvenile court. The next time he will take him to jail, not to his dad. There
is concealment and removal, he has to explain to his dad the difference, but
both are a crime. The kid has a swatch watch with a swatch guard too. After
Scott says he really didn't get through to the kid until he realized he could
go to jail. He finally figured it out when he started crying, that's when you
know you've made the point. Over the credits is footage with the body bag from
the first segment.

Officer Larry Burns says he moved there in 1980 to work construction, but he
was also interested in police work since they didn’t make a lot of money he
didn’t take it serious. After he spent his first night in a patrol car he knew

house and Tom answers. He talks to Kelly, she has her head in lap crying and
mumbling. Where did it happen, here? No. She knows the guy, he’s in his 40s,
50s. She was trying to sleep and this guy came over and tried to stick his
fingers in her. Tom’s seen him by the Jacuzzi, talked to him, doesn’t really
know him. They go around the corner, upstairs to the apartment where the guy
lives. There are two guys sitting at the kitchen table under a huge American
flag. There’s a shirtless bearded man climbing out the window and Jack pulls
his gun and says give me a reason. He comes back in and Jack asks him if he’s
Phil. He says no, he’s sleeping. They pull back the covers and Phil is in bed
in his underwear. He doesn’t want to get up, wants to know what’s wrong so Jack
jumps him and puts his knee on his back and cuffs him. He pulls him up and the
man says easy. Officer Peter Rubini talks to John Christian. They don’t know
what’s going on. He says Kelly was raped. She’s been there for two days and was
passed out in the bed stark naked. The old guy went in there and laid down,
they had a party, but he didn’t rape her. He didn’t do anything wrong, then she
got up screaming. They take him out and say the problem is when they go to the
jury it becomes a moral question instead of a legal question. Did he force
himself on her? The evidence shows him that he did. Laughlin, NV (5:4 PM Child
Neglect Complaint) Substation – Officer John Sias goes out to his truck and
says it is a boomtown. When he arrived 6 years ago there were only 92 people
living there, now there are 4500. On New Year’s Eve they had 70,000 people
there. Their problem is having a lot of transients. It’s known as a boomtown so
it draws a lot of people. He’s going to check on kids living in a trailer in
unsanitary conditions. He goes into a casino and asks for Jimbo or Jenny. They
aren’t sure if they are working. The kids are living in a trailer in the
parking lot. The manager tried to look inside, but there’s a big dog tied to
it. He drives them to the lot and there’s tons of trailers. He talks to the guy
inside about the complaint and asks if there’s anyone else there, he’s not the
father. John looks around, says it’s not safe and is unsanitary. He has to take
them to Child Haven. He tells the girl he’s taking her there, it’s a nice place
with toys, she’ll have to stay two days and be out Monday. Do you have a
special toy you want to bring? Yes, what about your brother Cordell? Can you
explain it to him? You are being a big girl, I need your help. He thanks the
guy and he says to go before he’s not so cooperative. John says he better
remain that way. The manager says he wants them out of there by tomorrow. They
find out Bobbie, the mother, works in the casino as a dealer and they go to
talk to her. She says she’s fine. John explains what happened and all she says
is really, someone complained? He says it’s a mess, no fridge, no food, the

hadn’t had a bath today. He’s taking the kids, they’ll be in the kids care, not
the detention side. Something has to be done. She’ll send them to her mom’s

Officer Thomas Fletcher gives him the money back and asks what happened. He was
walking on Freemont Street and Mike reached in his pocket and took his money.
He has polio, couldn’t chase him, told him to stop and is always in fear of his
life. He’ll go to jail as long as he agrees to testify. It’s a worse crime, a
larceny if he’s in fear. Mike specializes in victims, he watches and waits for
them, preys on them. They take him to jail, before it was just petty and
loitering, now it’s a felony, he’ll spend time in jail. (11:01 PM Communication

a white hard top. People want to jump in, but they say to stay back. They ask
for a large semi truck to block it. They talk to the woman owner who agrees
they can break the window. Officer Dennis Magill runs over, whacks it with the
nightstick on the passenger side and jumps in and stops it. The crowd cheers
and he gives high fives. They say it was a wise decision, $50 to replace the
window instead of smashing it with the trailer. They are all happy about it and
he goes back and helps clean the glass out. He asks her how did it happen? It
slipped out of park, she didn’t have it all the way in, got out and left it
running, it hit the trailer and went around in circles. He doesn’t know how it

White, Jr. meets with Officer Randy Sutton in his chambers. He says the warrant
is for a seizure of a bunch of guns. It started as a burglary of guns and drugs
- legal steroids from Jeff. He found the guy who robbed him and took Randy to
the suspect’s house in Henderson where he had the stuff. He told him the story
how he was put on his knees at gunpoint and interrogated. He asked him how he
came to Jeff’s house. He bought steroids from him for four months, he’s a big
guy, body builder. Randy went to Judge Levitt and got papers. He’s a big gun
aficionado. He came to the door with a glock on his hip when they arrested him.
He has AK-47, he went to jail, is out now, but they want to go back and get the
rest of the guns. Earle makes him swear that what he says is true and he does
and signs it. Randy says outside they aren’t arresting him, they are just
taking the guns, but they need warrants to remove the guns. Whenever you go to
seize guns there is a heightened sense of danger. (4:00 PM Execution of Search
Warrant) Randy knocks and tells Jeff to come out. A guy is standing and Randy
tells him to get down at gunpoint because he has a gun on him and takes it. He
asks if Jeff about the guns and he goes to get the key for the case and he
tells him to sit. He says they can take all his guns and he’s not happy about
it so they give him the warrant. They make him move away from the guns and
unload the gun from the guest. They go in the closest and pull out assault
rifles. The other guy had a pistol in a holster on his hip when they came in,
so it’s not CCW. They find a huge box of steroids so Jeff’s under arrest again.
He says they are the same ones from before. Under the bed are more guns and
they start putting them on the bed and soon the bed is covered. Officer Chuck
Pierce Jr. finds Jeff’s drug sales book and there are lots of high dollar sales
listed including one for $1,500. Randy by law has to make a list of all the
things he’s taking and knows he’s going to be there awhile and starts with an
Uzi. Chuck makes call to Jeff’s relatives that they are arresting him and
taking three semis, handguns, 100 pounds of ammo and 40-50 clips. Randy reads
the label on the steroids that says “for vets to administer to horses only” and
doesn’t think he would take something meant for horses. (10:20 PM Suspicious
Person) Northeast Area Command – Officer Thomas Fletcher says he’s been
fascinated by cops since he was five and grew up watching every cops show he
could watch. So he joined the Marine Corps, became a military policeman, got
out and has was hired in Vegas. He goes to a hotel at the 2000 block of
Freemont and tells Jerry who is drunk to come out of the bushes. He talks to
Peggy who was hiding from him and has kids, says they aren’t alone because
she’s paying for a babysitter. How does she afford it? Her boyfriend is in
prison. She’s been in Vegas for five days, she flushed her license, will show
something else for ID. The drunk guy says she was paying $188 a week for a
hotel and he was trying to find a cheaper place. She has Colorado ID, is going
to dealer school and college? Which is it? She says they are the same. The guy
says he sold his ID in 1987. They ask him why he did that. A guy needed it. The
girl cries, says she has a 19 month old kid, she knows the guy’s a punk and a
trouble maker, but she just moved here. The cops know the drunk guy. The cops
admit they don’t know him and tell her to relax, she says she’s not spazzing.
She met him at the Ambassador while playing some nickels slots and told him her
story. Her mom died two weeks ago, she’s from Clinton, IO and thought this
place was like Reno. What’s Reno like? Nicer. Tom is worried she’s out drinking
beer in the bushes while her kids are alone. She says they aren’t and she has a
5 year old and a 2 year old. They remember seeing Jerry drinking behind the
mini mart a few weeks ago. He admits he was there drinking. They tell him to
go. He goes to get her bag and she tells him not to. They tell Peggy she can go
and not to jump in the bushes with some scrounge she doesn’t know. She says
where she’s from they believe people. She doesn’t know anybody here and she
holds stuffed animals. They say she knows them know. Give them a call if she
needs anything from now on. They see a lot of people like that, they come with
their boyfriends and they leave them after a week and they have nothing, no
money no job, nowhere to go. (7:00 PM Disturbance Call) Northeast Area Command

earth. Their job is to do the best they can to protect them from those leeches.
It’s like the bullies in school, he never liked them. They take advantage of
the weak and it’s their job to protect them. He goes to a 7-11 where a drunk
man refuses to leave and now he’s harassing customers out front. He asks the
guy what’s the problem. His shirt is open, his fat gut is exposed, he says no
and walks away. Randy grabs him, says don’t walk away from me and asks him why
they got a call. He says his car got stolen, he’s not harassing anyone. He
tries to show his ID and says he’s had a lot to drink. His car was on the
corner there. He walks around and tries to smoke, but Randy doesn’t want him to
smoke. Want me to tell you what the truth is? Yes. He got high, gave money to a
guy, thought he was his brother, gave him the keys and he took off. Randy asks
what he was smoking. Rock. He gave the dealers his car so they could get more.
The car is a 1979 Ford Fairmont. How long has he been smoking? Do you want the
truth? Yes. Randy mirandizes him. He says he’ll tell him and understands his
rights. He doesn’t know the license plate number, but it’s in his name though.
All the paperwork is in the glove compartment. He gave it to them an hour ago
and never thought they would take it. He’s been getting high with them for
three days and knows where they live. He walks over and Randy says not to stand
next to him. He wants to tell him. What were the guys’ names? He can’t tell.
Randy arrests him for being under the influence of drugs. He cuffs him easily
and puts him in the car. On the way to the station Randy says cocaine isn’t
good for him. He asks him how much has he spent on dope in his life. He can’t
tell him, maybe $30-40,000 and it’s not cheap.

**Las Vegas, NV 4** (Firing Range) Metropolitan PD - Officer Randy Sutton fires
two clips. He was involved in a shooting incident using a 9mm. They shot at
each other about 5 feet apart. He hit him in the chest, the guy missed him, but
the suspect didn't even know he was hit, it didn't make him flinch. He decided
it was time to switch to a heavier caliber weapon, a 45. He doesn't know if
it’ll work better and hopefully won't find out. He then checks the target he
was shooting at. (7:40 PM Person with a Gun Call) The man is supposed to be at
the 7-11 near the airbase. He pulls up and walks up to a red car at gunpoint
and makes the people inside put their hands up. The female driver comes out and
he makes the passenger come out the same door. He asks what's going on and if
he has a gun and he says yes. He makes him get his hands away, go down on his
knees with his hands on head and then he cuffs him. He brings him over to his
car, calls it in, and takes the gun. The guy says he's holding it for a friend.
She says she didn't know about it. He says he doesn't know if it’s loaded, but
it is. Backup arrives and searches him. They ask what his friends name is. He
thinks about it for a while and says Ricky. He got it from a guy and got in
trouble, so he's holding it for him. He's 19, he'll get concealment, and
charged with having the serial number filed off. They find a bag of bullets,
money and drugs. Everything is his, but the drugs are his friends.
(Prostitution Sting) Officer Andrea Burman listens as Lt. Bill Young explains
the game plan – a reverse soliciting targeting the Johns. Big problem lately,
lots of them. He has Las Vegas Blvd drawn on the board. She'll take them into
room 126 at an apartment complex. They'll have control room next door and two
cops in the bathroom in her room. (11:40 PM) She walks on the street and guy
pulls up. He says he works for the military and asks what pleases her. She says
anything. He asks for a BJ and she says $20 and to meet her at apt 126. She
tells him she just got there from California, has been there for two days and
is getting all wet. She tells him to make himself comfortable and she’ll go in
the bathroom. Mike and Leon bust him. The guy says 'oh, no. It's embarrassing."
They tell him it's worse to get AIDS. There are now 72 whores that have AIDS on
the street. He'll get a citation and they don't want to see him again. (12:20
PM) A guy walks over, he has a half-ounce of crack he wants to exchange for sex
and brings a friend. One guy smokes and the other has a bag of beers. He asks
her if she goes fast. She doesn’t understand and the cops jump out. She says
the guy offered $20 for a BJ. She doesn't know what go fast is. The other guy
wanted to have fun and has no money. The guy says he didn't have any meth, he
was lying to her. The bring the hairy hippy guy with the beers says he was just
going to sit there and drink beers and watch, he never made a deal. They let
him go, then they find meth and needles on him and bring him back. Bill says he
doesn't want those people in Vegas, if she wasn't a cop she would've been in
trouble, that's the payoff. (11:00 PM Domestic Disturbance Call) Northeast Area
Command gets a call and Randy is right there when it comes in. He pulls the
woman out and she says she wants him out, doesn't want to live under the same
roof, he's a drunk, it will help him. They've been married 30 years, and it's
30 years too long. He drinks all day, abuses her and tears her nerves to
pieces. Randy can't remove him since he lives there. She tries to stay away all
day so she doesn't have to be with him and can't even relax in her own damn
trailer. Officer Russell Peterson backs him up. He has no relatives and if he
did they wouldn't take him. Randy goes in and talks to Jack. He has a wound on
his arm and says she bit him and he called the cops on her. She says she's on
medication and doesn't need it until she's around him. Randy asks her if she
knows about the domestic violence law. She doesn't know. He says if violence
happens within four hours of them arriving he has to arrest someone. She is
under arrest, but she thinks Jack is having her arrested. Randy says Jack
doesn't know and he has to do it. She beat him with a broom and wants her
purse. They'll get it. She says it's the most humiliating, disturbing thing.

**Las Vegas, NV 5** (7:20 PM Runaway Child) Metropolitan Police Dept - Officer
Randy Sutton goes to the call of Jessie, an eight year-old boy, who ran away an
hour ago after a domestic dispute and hasn't been seen since. He pulls up to
\#2645, clipboard in hand. The woman says he was beating up on some kids and she
got done talking to him and sent him to his room until dinner and he might not
get any. She never does that. Then her younger son Ricky told her he ran out
the door with his backpack filled with toys. She went to the school, drove
around to look for him, but didn’t find him. Randy calls Gloria on the phone
then there is a knock on the door. The neighbors found Jessie and returned him.
Randy calls the kid over and asks why he did it. He says Dave and cries. He
says Dave hits him and all that, he’s his baby brother’s dad. He hits them
both. Ricky says he doesn’t hit him. Jess says he does. He kicks him in the
head in the morning to get him to go to school. He shows a mark on his face
from him. He ran away because of Dave and thought his mom would be better off
without him. Randy says that’s not true and he’ll talk to them both if he
promises not to run away again. She’s holding a baby and says Dave never hit
him with a belt, but he’s threatened to use it. He’s never been punched or
slapped, but doesn’t know how he got the mark on his face. He doesn’t like Dave
because he’s strict with him, he’s the only one who can keep him in line. She
told him Dave would take care of him when he got home, that might be why he ran
away. Randy sees no signs of abuse and lets him stay there. He leaves and
thinks there is a grain of truth to the story, so he’s filing a report on it.
(10:30 PM Traffic Stop) Southeast Area Command – Officer Dominick Rodriguez
says if he can help someone out he’ll do it. That’s the best thing when you see
someone in a tight spot who needs help and you can come through for them it’s a
good feeling. He spots a small car run through a red light, it’s one of his pet
peeves because it causes a lot of accidents. Carrie is laughing when he walks
up. She says it wasn’t red when she went through and doesn’t have her license
because she left it at home. She doesn’t drink, doesn’t do nothing. He writes
her a ticket. She’s never run a red light before. He has her sign the ticket.
She says deep inside she fells like he thinks she’s really guilty. He says he’s
doesn’t, don’t be too upset about it, just don’t do it again. She says she’s
shy and goes to start the car and it won’t start. She says it’s a bad
alternator. She says it’s a 4 speed and she’s not good at push starting it. He
says she has a complex. He’ll push her, pop it into second when she gets to the
sign and it’ll be ready to go. He pushes her with the police car, then pulls up
next to her and she says she ran out of gas. He says he’ll drive her to the gas
station. She says it’s really embarrassing. He takes her to a phone and she
calls the wrong he number. Then she calls her mom Carol and can’t handle it.
Dom talks to her, says he needs to give Carrie a ride home. He explains she has
a leak and doesn’t want to leave her at the 7-11, but he can’t drive her across
town, she’ll be at Flamingo and Eastern. He feels safe leaving her there. Clark
County Detention Center - Lt. Patricia Kessel says the first time coming to
jail has got to be a horrendous experience, she would be terrified and she’s
been there 12 years now. If you get someone shouting orders here and there,
telling you do this, do that and you don’t know what’s happening to you, you
are not a free person. It’s understandable that you are upset. They teach
officers IPC – Inter Personal Communication. One of the most vital parts of
their training program is to teach folks that when someone comes in and they
are angry, calling you every obscene name in the book, clutching at you,
grabbing at you or whatever, it’s not you they are angry at, it’s what you
represent. They bring a drunk guy in and take his picture. He’s an older guy,
says he’s got money and drives a Cadillac. They don’t want to hear he’s someone
who knows the sheriff and everyone. Pat says they want a blood sample from him.
They don’t want to grab them by the hair, it looks really bad, it’s a tactic
that hurts, but doesn’t injure. It gets their attention, you have to get their
attention before they’ll listen to you. The guy from before hit his face on the
wall and bust his nose and mouth. He’s bleeding and a nurse cleans him up. Pat
begs him to cooperate, they aren’t there to fight. He needs to agree to submit.
He says he’s not fighting with anyone. She says he just needs to do what they
ask. He says he’s not resisting and agrees to take a breath test, it’s that or
blood. Officer Jack Clark talks to a woman who is belligerent. She curses him
out and wants the cuffs off, but he won’t. She says someone needs to. She was
caught giving oral sex in the back of a car and her fly is open. The guy from
before says Jack hit him, someone hit him. He explains he hit the wall outside.
Then he refuses the blood test so they take him off to the drunk tank. They
smell alcohol on him. They’ll let him calm down and sleep it off. They take
blood from another guy who asks why they are doing it. He says he wants them to
test it for every kind of disease. The guy from before got all squirrelly in
isolation. He got the cuffs off and punched a cop right in the face. They’ll
have to file a report. They’ve heard, “I know the sheriff, the governor, I pay
your salary.” She wants to ask them for a raise then.

and K-9 Eich are needed and go to the scene. Sgt. Doug Gillespie tells him 575
wants to know what's going on 44 and 420, ran out the back. Patrol went to a
house to get someone on a homicide warrant and the guy took off out the back
door. He's armed with a knife and wanted for battery with a deadly weapon. He
says the guy hopped over the back wall. Mike goes around back with the dog into
a garage and asks an owner if they can go into their backyard to search. He
says it's the worst kind of search he can do, he's worried more about getting
shot by a resident than a suspect. They think someone is trying to rob them and
shoot out their window or let their dogs out. He doesn't find anything and
hears cops calling because another K-9 unit found him. He's cuffed on the
ground with the dog trying to get him. One dog almost gets him and they yell at
him to walk past them. He walks like he has all the time in the world. Mike has
to yell to get the dog to stop. The guy says he just pushed her away, he's told
he has warrants for attempted assault and attempted sexual battery. Mike trades
barbs with the other K-9 officer. He calls him a rookie and he found him first,
Mike says his dog was calm enough to cuff him, Doug says he would be calm too
since he didn't make the catch. Mike says it's beginners luck, he's still a
rookie and can't lie, there is competition, he wanted to make the catch, but
Eich thinks he did anyway, so he still thinks he's top dog. (4:00 PM Indecent
Exposure Call) Officer Randy Sutton says there are 240 million people in the
country and only 500,000 cops. When you put on that uniform it's a lot of
responsibility. The courts decided a cop can be sued as well as the department.
What he worked so hard to get can be removed from him if the court decides he
violated someone's rights. He goes to the call of Tanya who can see a man in
his apartment with the drapes open masturbating in the window. The woman is
outside when he pulls up and she points to where he is, but can't see him now.
He backs up to get out of the way. She says he stands in the window with the
curtains up and the window open and he plays with himself, it's embarrassing.
She's getting sick of it and he acts like he hides. Tanya will file a crime
report on him. Randy knocks on B1 and the guy says he's alone and he's wearing
nothing but a small towel around his waist. Randy mirandizes him and asks if he
knows why he's here. He says what is he supposed to say, he has a problem with
her, but doesn't know her. He has scars on his back, knows what he was doing
was wrong, is not going to deny it, but it was a spur of the moment thing.
There was something about her, he saw her at the pool, liked the way she looked
and thinks she's married. He's done it a couple times in front of her, but just
her. He can see her across the way, finds her sexually attractive and there's
not much he can really say. Randy tells him to get dressed. He has to go
downtown and be charged with open and gross lewdness. If he's never been
arrested they'll let him go. Is it necessary for him to be arrested. It's
illegal to masturbate in front of women in Nevada. (12:15 AM Disturbance Call)
Southeast Area Command - Officer Dominick Rodriguez says he always wanted to
become a cop, was raised in this town and knows it sounds corny but he loves
his community. He wanted to be a cop since he was a kid and wants to
participate in helping the community instead of complaining about it. There are
people in the emergency room raising heck and refusing to leave. A woman points
to security and says two young guys are drunk and creating a disturbance. Mike
cut off the tip of his finger and wanted to be seen first and got obnoxious. He
asked him to leave, he wouldn't, they are packed and she wants him out. She
will file a trespass on him. They guy is on the phone when Dom goes in. He
tells him to get off. He says he's been there 90 minutes, he needs stitches and
needs help now. He has a bloody towel on his hand and called 911 and they said
they have to help him. Mike says the guard is playing Mr. Hero, won't help him,
he's there first. Dom says it's a private hospital and they don't have to take
care of him. Mike says his uncle is Chuck Thompson and he'll take care of them
all. A guy and a girl come over and start yelling it's a customer service
problem. He asks if someone had a gun in his stomach would they wait? The guy
comes back and says he's been bleeding for two hours and Dom says he'll arrest
Donald for obstruction. They feel strongly about him leaving, he'll go in and
talk to them. He talks to a woman who says it's not an emergency and not life
threatening. He needs 2 maybe 3 stitches and he's only been there 30 minutes.
The others are a priority, they take them in priority order, people came in by
ambulance and he spread the wound apart to make it bleed. Mike says she told
him it would be 5 stitches. The waiting process is part of the game. He denies
he was there only 30 minutes. Dom sympathizes with them, but they have to play
the game and wait, other people have problems too.

chose the job because his brother was in the department and most people on the
block were cops, so he figured he might as well join. He's driving toward the
WTC and says there's excellent job security, the money's not bad, the benefits
are great and someone has to do it, doesn't mind helping people out once in a
while, that's the job. Officer Robert Falconetti is his partner and they go to
the call of a man shot in his car on Second and New York Ave. He is put in the
ambulance since he's hit in the head. The car is off to the side on the curb
with bullet holes in the window and spent shells on the ground so they leave it
to the investigators. A call comes in that someone saw the shooter so they
drive over to his backyard and eight cops chase down the tall black guy who
says he doesn't know what happened. He's the right guy, but they can't find the
gun that fired the 10 shots. (2:30 AM Shooting Call) Another shooting happened
down the road, another fun night in the city. Tony is a black guy sitting on
some stairs with a wound to the neck. They ask who shot him, he doesn't know,
they took his wallet. They tell the ambulance to hurry since he's falling over.
Tom tells the guy to go and asks if he stutters. EMS arrives. It's common in
the projects, close to the first of the month, today is the fourth, they've had
enough time to get their checks and go crazy. They go out on foot and ask the
people around if they saw anything, but no one says a thing. There are lots of
violent crimes and no one wants to rat on their friends. It's the code of
silence, if they rat on someone, they'll be next. Hoboken - Sgt. Mike Plunkett
asks the officers if they have their helmets and hands out their night sticks.
They are short handed with only four of them until 8 o’clock. Have a good
night. His great-great grandfather was a cop there in 1876 and his family has
lived there since. There’s not as many crimes as there used to be. Lots of the
bars now cater to the yuppies, instead of the working class when he was a kid,
lots more fights back then. (5:15 PM Disturbance Call) He’s going to Redheads
bar where the owner has a bat on a customer. The guy says a man threatened him
over the phone with a bat. Someone broke into his house in Jersey City and has
a bat with his name on it. They talk to the owner who says the guy charged
$1300 on his account for City Paint and Johnny is getting billed for it. The
guy says he used him as a reference and they sent the bill here by mistake. He
says he bought stuff for the lady and they mistakenly assumed it was for
Redheads. They said to bill it to Redheads and he said fine. He's paying it
right now. He says Johnny told him his house was robbed. The Sgt. says the guy
knew they were charging him and he gets tired of the guy talking and
interrupting him. He yells at him to stop and tells Johnny he can file a
complaint with the detective, it's a lot of money. He can file right now if
he's threatened. Johnny says he didn't say it. The guy keeps saying he can't
watch his back and the Sgt. believes Johnny. The guy keeps saying it's against
the law to make threats and the account has been settled so he can do what he
want. It'll be settled in court, not here. After Mike says people come from all
over the world to see the NYC skyline and they see it every day. The shot
includes the WTC. Orange PD - Officer Dennis Vega says it's good to know the
community you are in. He was born and raised there. Lots of the cops there were
born and raised in Orange and are trying to give back to the town. He goes to a
block party and shakes hands with people as do other cops. (3:15 PM Domestic
Call) A man took his child from the mother so they go to her rundown apartment
and talk to the mother. The door is bashed and smashed and has ‘Jones’ written
on it in marker. He won't open the door so they call him on the phone and tell
him to open the door. He puts the mom on the phone and she says she wants her
baby, he tells her to screw off. Her friend has a shirt that reads 'If you
don't like my attitude dial 1-800-eat-sh!t' right in front of her kids. Dennis
gets back on the phone and says he wants to make sure the baby is OK and to
clear the hall. He finally opens the door and is still on the phone. He
surrenders the kid, shakes the guys hand and tells him he can't use their kid
to solve their problems. It'll make him look bad, even if he's right. These
kind of situations can be explosive. The job has lots of judgment calls. Over
the credits the WTC is seen from a distance.

Southeast Area Command - Officer Jack Clark says because of the area with the
high concentration of bars and casinos they have a DWI problem. People are
either walking or driving, then it becomes a much more serious problem to put a
thousand pound car in the hands of a drunk. He pulls over a white rental
Cadillac with the horn stuck. They pop the hood and he tells them they can pull
it and take it back to Budget. Then it suddenly stops. Metrocom Center - a call
comes in for an officer down emergency. They radio Jack and he takes off. A cop
got run over at Circus Circus, but they don't know if it's a real cop or
security. He pulls up and Officer Frank Janise is down on the street with a
stream of blood coming from his head. One man keeps him down, another holds his
hand. Jack calls for an ETA on EMS. More people arrive and they caught the
older male driver who hit him and has no license. EMS cuts Frank's jacket off.
A witness says he had to chase the driver down the street. He wasn't sure what
the guy was doing, he was trying to make up his mind what to do. He stopped and
the man reached in and grabbed his keys. They think he's drunk and give him a
field test. There was a DWI accident scene and Frank was there. The drunk ran
through the scene and hit him. He's arrested for felony DWI because of the
drinking and the injuries. They take Frank to University Medical Center for
lacerations to his head, broken ribs and broken wrist. He was investigating a
DWI and stopped traffic, the suspect drove through the accident scene, hit
Frank and he went to leave. A guard chased him down and made him come back.
(Seven Months Later) Officer Frank Janise talks about the accident. He arrived
at the accident scene and went to get flares and find out about getting blood
drawn for BAC. That's the last thing he remembers. He was told the man came
across the Industrial road, went over the double line and hit him. The mirror
on the truck hit him in the head and something cut through his shirt, jacket
and vest. (5:50 PM Accident Call) He goes to where another cop has a man
stopped and thinks he's drunk. Officer David Wagner explains the guy was making
a westbound turn on Paradise, then a lady hit the back of the cab, plus there's
a second accident. He gives the man a field test. Frank talks to the woman. She
says the man sandwiched the guy between the truck and the cab almost killing
him. (8:10 PM Accident Call) He goes to the call of a three car accident where
paramedics have already arrived. He pulls up and the scene is full of people.
He talks to a blonde woman who says the white car tried to make a left hand
turn and the red car didn't yield. The white car's front is smashed in and the
red car looks like a tinfoil ball. He can relate to them better because he was
never involved in a DWI accident until he was hit. Everyone had seatbelts
except for one lady in an 85 Oldsmobile who only got lacerations. The driver
was lucky he had his belt on so he survived. The old saying is if you drink,
don't drive. (6:40 PM Suspicious Vehicle) Northeast Area Command - Officer
Thomas Fletcher has been assigned to the downtown area as a foot patrol
officer. They run into a lot of homeless, a lot of robberies, find that a lot
of their suspects come from in other cities. Then they find out they are also
wanted back home, it's a very transient area. A red car is driving around a
parking lot and they ask them what is the woman doing in the trunk of the
hatchback and tell him to stop. He pulls over and they ask him why she is
there. They were trying to get a room but it was $25. She has an Australian
accent and says she's rode 5000 miles back there, that's why her leg is sore.
The driver says he's rode back there. Officer Joseph Lombardo says he wouldn't
ride there. Everything she owns is inside there and they laugh about it. (7:10
PM Domestic Disturbance) A woman is supposed to be holding a baby on the street
and park rangers have her. They pull up and she is gone. The ranger points to
where they went. They are across four lanes of traffic. Joe walks over and
there is a man, woman and kid standing there. Cindy is upset, says her husband
beat her and the cops let him go again. He's drunk and has a warrant out for
his arrest. She's putting tape on a large cardboard box on the ground. Her
husband knew she didn't have any money, thinks he went home and left her there.
The guy with her is a stranger who gives her some money. He says it won't help
much, but she shouldn't be out here like that. Her daughter is two and she told
him she was going back to her parents in Phoenix. He was going to take her to
get her check and he dropped her off there and left. He wants her to go and he
told her so. She has no money, except what the guy gave her. She was going to
get $128 from her check and Greyhound bus tickets as $32. Cops take her box,
put it in their trunk and will go to Greyhound, they have some money. They
drive her to the huge bus terminal and ask when the next bus is to Phoenix.
It's 12:15am. They buy her a ticket and tell her if he shows up again tonight
and tries to force her to do anything to tell the front desk and they'll come
as fast as they can.

Martin says many trucks are getting broken into and getting hit heavy after
getting steered off the turnpike down one way streets with no way to turn
around. Conrail loaned them a surveillance van used in Boston. Chief Inspector
Art Dunn from the Conrail PD shows it off on the inside. Zenith gave them empty
VCR, camcorder and TV boxes and they are glued and taped together to look
flush. The giant crate on the left side is where the cops hide and it opens up
to block the thieves in by wedging against the with a board on the floor. It's
set up nice so they'll run inside and grab the equipment. They are in back of
the projects. Officer Paul is driving the 18 wheeler Trailvan and pretends he
broke down. He gets out, pops the hood and a black guy comes right up to him,
then Paul leaves it. Seconds later three black kids come up to break the seal
with a stick. (5:15 PM Truck Interior) Officer Andrew Lancellotti explains to
the rest how many will come in and then they can open it. There's a bathroom
and a long bench to sit inside the large crate. The kid in a white shirt and
red shorts goes back to get a broom to break the seal. They are so excited when
they get in and run saying "VCRs!!" Police jump them and they are surprised.
They say they'll drive it over to Duncan and Sgt. Walter Barrett follows them
over. They explain to Paul which way to turn and open the hood so they can see
it better then he walks away from the truck. (7:55 PM) A black kid in white
shorts works on the lock. He gets it open and excitedly signals his friends to
come. When one joins him they jump them, but the second guy gets away. The
first guy says they made him do it. When they pull him out of the truck a group
of women laugh at him. He says he's 14. It starts to get dark so they call it
off. He says they'll meet up and get them out of the back and they are
thankful. Tomorrow they'll start earlier. Captain Bobby Martin says they did a
good job yesterday and will do it again today. It's a big industry, a billion
dollars a year of theft. They are going back to Duncan. We see cops have to
enter the crate from a trapdoor in the bottom of the truck. They stop near a
park and call the truck. They tell him to turn the nose their way. He pops the
hood and fiddles with the engine to make it look good. He goes in and grabs his
briefcase and walks away. (3:30 PM) There is a large pack of black men across
the street. One of them grabs a screwdriver and heads over as another becomes a
lookout. The guy gets the lock off and madly jumps in and is grabbed. The
others jump through the door and grab the second guy. It's Christmas in August,
they are setting up again. There are only certain streets in the city
designated for trucks and people will steer them the wrong way so they can rob
them. The move the truck to a new street. (6:15 PM) Four guys appear and one
goes in the cab. A Hispanic man in a white hat pops the seal and calls to his
buddies "VCRehs!" He grabs one, they jump him and drop out the bottom and grab
the others. He says he has no dope on him, his hat comes off on the way out and
says he's the only one to blame. He uses a hand pumper as the tool. It took
only six minutes for them to park and break in. Captain Bobby Martin says they
do a lot of proactive and reactive stuff patrolling hot areas where there are
purse snatchings and house entries. Where there is bad crime they will set up
and let them do the crime and catch them in the act, they are the witnesses in
court. It's not a victim, it's the police as witnesses, so 9 times out of 10
they'll cop a deal. (12:10 AM Suspicious Situation) They spot Rob going in and
out of a super market with a bag in the pouring rain. The bag was empty at
first, now it's full. They watch him for a while to see where he goes. He goes
up 5th and they stop him in the street. They ask if he bought the stuff, but he
has no receipts. He threw them away and has no money left. He has 20 packs of
cigarettes. Rob looks familiar to them and they ask him if he got busted for
breaking into a car. He says he doesn't do that stuff, but they did bust him 2
1/2 weeks ago. They saw him outside the Pathmark for 20-30 minutes and go back
to the store to see if he bought them. A manager says he saw Rob there, but he
didn't buy anything. Officer Andrew Lancellotti asks if can they ID the stuff.
The cigarettes have a 4004 number on them that is the code for the store. He
was running around, that why he didn't have a receipt. He stashed a bag by the
diner and came back and grabbed more and went back. He was waiting for the rain
to let up. He was there since 11 PM. Special thanks to Chief Richard J.
Harrison.

**New Jersey 4** (10:45 PM Roll Call) Jersey City – The Sgt. tells officers the
Puerto Rican parade goes down to Grundy Park so give it special attention.
That's it. One cop says he’s on motorcycle 56. Officer Thomas Porter says what
he likes most is the people he's with, they are a rare breed, not many people
like to work at midnight and sleep all day. His partner is Officer Robert
Falconetti who says there is less traffic, it’s more informal, a different
class of people and is best shift in the city (Saturday 11:56 PM Assault Call)
Thomas says there are lots more violent crimes, it's not Mayberry. They go up
to Daisy who says her boyfriend Ruben Trinidad punched her in the head and
scratched her with a knife. He took the keys and dropped the knife. He's riding
a bike, in a white t-shirt, black shorts and a blue Morley's hat. They know him
and go to a park where he hangs out. He's been arrested before, everyone knows
him, not a great guy, every cop and everyone in town knows him. He'll probably
come back, he's stupid enough to. There are a bunch of guys sitting at a table
who say Ruben left an hour or so ago. They talk to Mike on a corner who says he
hasn't seen him all day as a pack of people behind him make noise. They say to
call if he sees them and go back to Daisy and her friends to see if he came
back. She needs to go to 762 Montgomery St. on Monday to file a complaint
unless they catch him first. He'll come back, he's cocky. (Thursday, 9:40 PM
Assault Call) They get a call of a female being assaulted right where Daisy was
last time. It turns out she is Daisy. A woman says he tried to get her again,
busted his eye open and he's out inn the back yard. They go out there and it's
totally dark. Ruben is down on the ground by an underground door. He was trying
to climb into a window to escape, fell and hit his head. He's Mexican, with a
big dorag. He says, “I can't stand up, I'm dizzy yo.” Tom is going to cuff him
and Ruben says he's tough, he'll show him how tough he is even when he's
cuffed. Tom says he's tough too. Ruben says he's a punk, he can't beat him one
on one. Daisy says she didn't want to be with him once he got drunk. They were
all hanging out together and then it got bad. She is holding ice on her face
and doesn't care what they do to him now. They are charging him with assault.
He says he doesn't need to be charged with that. He ends everything with yo and
curses them out. He says he can curse all he wants and is going to court on
Monday for beating up a cop and didn't resist. They have him in a cage and ask
him to spell his name and he says to make sure they spell it right, like
Trinidad and Tobago. He hangs all over, that's why they can't find him. He's
been locked up many times, has an extensive record, no girls like him and they
reject him so he beats them up. She signed a complaint on him and the state has
the toughest domestic violence laws in the country. Orange, NJ (10:20 PM Street
Patrol) Officer Dennis Vega says most of the time he winds up doing what he's
taught, not on the job, but when you were younger, how to treat people and how
to react in different situations. If you get physical that doesn't solve things
it creates new problems. If you fight with everyone you are not going to make
it, this is not the job for it. A black guy flags him down and says his cousin
has a problem with his sister and his kids. He says there is going to be a
fight, but he can't explain it. He wants Dennis to go there, but he won't until
he understands. He says the cousin and his ex are fighting over their kid and
he'll ride down there on the hood if he wants. It started right there and now
they're by the ice cream parlor. He says he's a short bald f--ker. The guy runs
down there and Dennis meets him at the corner. A woman says the guy is lying on
Bell Street all beat up. A witness says a guy beat him up and left him there.
The guy is on his back spread out and mumbling. He indicates he can't breathe
and can't move his leg. He starts crying and screaming. Dennis calls an
ambulance. The cousin holds him down. The guy starts screaming and moving his
legs because he wants him off him. He wants him to shut up. He keeps trying to
get up and T holds him down. EMS arrives and T wants them to help, but the
victim doesn't want their help, he can do it his own way, so Dennis calls them
off. They started fighting on Jefferson St., he got bopped, is probably on the
pipe and couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag. There was nothing the
police could do about it, just can't let it get out of control and won't solve
anything tonight.

**New Jersey 5** (12:47 AM Disturbance Call) Hoboken - Officer Mike Plunkett
became an officer for the same reason most people do - to change the world, be
somebody’s knight in shining armor, rid the city of all crime. It's a good
attitude to have when you first come on, you need that, but when you’re on the
streets a few weeks the reality check is you won't be a knight on shining
armor, you can't change the streets and the best you can do is make your world
a little better. When you retire you'll have a pretty good career to look back
on. If you can survive 25 years you've got it made. It’s usually around the
time when the bars start closing and there are a lot of problems. They
centralize themselves in the areas where the bars are in case of problems. He
pulls up to a bunch of guys fighting on a sidewalk. Two groups separate as one
man in a blue shirt fights and a cop grabs him. A citizen takes his cuffs and
cuffs the guy. His friend wants to take him home. They say too late, he’s under
arrest. They say some guys threw him around and tossed him out. Ten guys did
it, but they didn’t get thrown out. Why is getting arrested, they came out and
found him? He assaulted a cop. Mike says he listened to him, now he can go
home. How can he, that guy is his ride. He doesn’t care. Det. Brian Murphy says
they went to take him out and he got loud and abusive and didn’t want to listen
and pushed him around, he didn’t get hurt, just winded. Mike talks to the
suspect at the station. He says he had his drinks, no problems, was having a
good time. Then somebody said something to him, he came back, said something
again. Then bing bang boom he hit the guy, but he didn’t know he was a cop or
he wouldn’t have touched him. He should’ve looked first. He’s sure Mike’s been
in a position like that before. No. You won’t admit it. He then realized he was
a cop. Maybe you had too much to drink. I did. He can live with that. After
Mike asks how could he not know he was a cop, he was in full uniform. It wasn’t
like he was wearing a Good Humor uniform. He was blind drunk. He’ll get a
summons, be home in an hour, should spend a weekend in county jail, maybe he’ll
think twice before whacking a cop again. Jersey City (Narcotics Unit Briefing)
Sgt. Brian McDonough says they caught a girl with cocaine and she told them
there was a house with two Spanish chicks selling cocaine out of there. They
have a warrant and it’s the top apartment #129. Sgt. Edwin Gillen says she’s an
old heavy woman, over 50, maybe 45. Brian explains how they will go up and
batter the door, it’s the weekend, don’t get hurt for it. Det. Dennis DeSefano
says they are Medellin and laughs. (11:45 PM Service of Warrant) He says when
they see the last man go in, Mike, go down the block and cover the sides of the
building in case something comes out the window. They go up, knock, say
‘Policia’, then ram the door. A woman can be heard. Inside there are babies
crying, they grab the woman and make her sit, they find an older woman, a man
and three babies they secure. Dennis grabs wads of cash that are in a purse.
They also find a welfare bundle of cash. The government is good to them. She
laughs. They search her and make the family speak to her in Spanish and tell
her to turn over any drugs or weapons. They also find a room of stolen clothes,
all still have tags on them, enough for a 100 people. It’s like doing inventory
for JC Penney. One has a tag for $50. They rob stores and trade them for drugs.
Six suitcases full of kids shoes, a $75 David Benjamin dress, his wife doesn’t
wear those and $60 pants. The woman in yellow says she likes it, she uses it.
Good country, eh? The kids all scream and now they are worried about the kids
when they are taking them out for locking up the grandmother. He’s worried
about the kids while they deal. They see that and hate the cops, he would too
if he was a kid. Brian says the grandmother was hiding in the closet with a
couple grams of coke, she was the one in charge. They have a little bit of
drugs and a lot of money, a lot of jewelry too. The daughter is in the cage
yelling. They find an Irish good luck ring are any of them Irish? Did you go to
St. Michael’s High School in 1972? It’s not the families jewelry it’s someone
else’s. Jersey City (11:50 PM) Officer Thomas Porter gets out of his car at a
park that overlooks the NYC skyline with the World Trade Center. They park
everywhere, but there’s a fire pump they block. He has to chase them away to
get them to park somewhere else. (12:21 AM Stolen Car Call) He gets in his car
and they give chase on the Pulasky Skyway into Newark. Officer Robert
Falconetti drives. A cop tells them they are ‘crazy Marty.’ They stop on a
bridge, get out and run. Sirens are heard down the road. They are supposed to
be around somewhere. They look over the bridge thinking he went over, but he
didn’t jump, he was hanging over the side. They ask the guy they caught where
do your friends live. On High St. in Jersey City. They go down and look up.
They were chased down the ramp and one of the guys is hiding in the weeds
somewhere. There was an accident the police were handling and they were trapped
with nowhere to go so one guy jumped off the ramp, but who knows. (Street
Patrol) Cops go to a lot where kids robbed a truck full of candy. Kids are
dumping candy in a lot. The people say there wasn’t much before, then they saw
them come around and dump some more. They ask what kind of truck it was. They
are from the factory back there, it’s a white truck. It’s a candy caper. Thomas
jokes for them to be under arrest and they all do and laugh. They doubt the
thief will come back and the kids are having a ball with it, the candy is
probably bad, but they’ll let them have fun with it. (1:47 AM) They find a car
turned on its side. They parked it in front of a gate that reads, “No No No
parking Anytime” in white spray paint. They got mad at them so the cops help
out and turn the car back over. Over the credits is the mother daughter drug
team at the station.

it down a sewer. Jersey City (11:45 PM Roll Call) Officer Elayne Zadroga says

woman, was drinking and did nothing and the owner told her to leave and she
didn't want to. They ask her to leave and she gets loud and points in Elayne's
face. She pushes her finger away and Anne gets belligerent and it takes 3 cops
to cuff and get her out. Her shoes fall off and so does her wig. They take her

Rottweiler and he trained him for 4 months. The first time he saw the dog go
after someone on the street for going after him and it was amazing. You get
attached. He's seen two K-9 men lose their dogs. You see grown men crying over
a dog and it's strange, but now he understands the attachment. He chases a
silver Mercedes Benz on Clarissa St. Traffic gets in way and he yells. It's a
personalized plate. They bail out on foot and give chase. He tells Louie "good
boy" over and over. They catch a young black guy near a bunch of cars. Phil
says if he moves he'll break his head open. The other got away beside the
hospital. They make the guy lie down and run out to the street to look for the
other guy. He tells a guy to watch him and goes over to the next guy who is
caught by a civilian behind the Atlantic. Four guys were in the car and two
were caught. The guy had to jump on the car to get away from the dog, he was
proud. (11:24 PM Street Patrol) Officer Thomas Harris says the ladies of the
evening are out. They are going to disperse them instead of arresting them. The
area of the hill is heavy with whores. He spots a girl who tries to hide who
would rather be arrested than get a lecture. They run from him hard to avoid
lectures. He talks to a woman who says she's waiting for a bus. There were
whores around who moved on and she's not working. She's a diabetic and can't
use drugs. He knows the prostitutes and hasn't seen her before, if he sees her
again he won't buy it. You can fool him once, maybe twice. Tom says two cars
just checked her out. Leon pulls up and they don't recognize her. She lives in
Liberty, but can't say which street. She does have ID though. He asks where her
carfare is. She doesn't understand and says she has a bus pass. She digs around
for it and he says he's had checks come faster in the mail. She keeps looking
and can't find it. He says she played him and she wants her tissues back. He
says he doesn't want her snot rag and will engrain her face into his brain. He
would rather she told him the truth and he wouldn't have arrested her, but she
danced around him like Ginger Rogers. She says she stays at East Liberty, but
was staying with her nieces. She finally admits she came out there to work. His
head is spinning, he's insulted. (11:40 PM 911 Call) Officer Joe Arroyo first
started working at the jail when there was a full moon and there were lots of
suicides and attempts. On the streets it makes people nuts, usually they are

tells him she loves him, Carol loves him, Crystal loves him and to come down.
Mom loves her. He asks if she wants him to jump. She says no. They won't touch
him if he comes down, they'll just take him to get help. He starts coming down,
doesn't remember climbing up there, he was drinking and sobered up when he got

The landlady says they both rent there. If she wants to leave she'll have to

TV and she had nothing when they moved in. She doesn't stop talking for a

him, got in his face and he stabbed him. He didn't mean to kill him, he's not
no murderer. (8:19 PM 911 Call) Officer Thomas Harris has been there 14 years,
but his ideals changed. At first it was a career opportunity, steady job, you
go through phases, everyone goes to jail, you are going to change the world.
Now he chooses prevention. If you can wake someone up before they get in the
system, then you've done more than the system can do. It starts raining hard as
a man is interfering with a baby. They are outside and the mother gave the baby
to the dad who is a drunk with a flat top. He says he drinks, but is not a
drunk. She is drunk and mouthing off that she works hard. Thomas is mad, he
says the kid should be inside and should be taken to child protective services.
The witness says that's why he called. Thomas says forget this and they chase
after them to take the kid. The mother flips out, fights, get hysterical and
the dad asks can't he take her home? They take the kid to the station and will
lock the parents up. Officer Kim Braddock holds the baby. Thomas tells the dad
to permit it is the same as doing it. The witness says he tried to get the
carriage up over the curb and it fell twice and the kid fell out both times.
The original witness is also there and saw them drunk and fighting. They were
in a bar drinking with the kid and passed the kid off to some derelict so they
could fight. Child Youth Services is advised so a relative can be called.
Thomas talks to the mom and says she needs to put the baby's well being ahead
of her fun. She says her baby is with her, she takes the baby with her when she
goes drinking since she can't get a babysitter. She says if she wants to go out
with her man, that's fine. Thomas says she isn't getting it. She says if the
kid fell why come she not bruised. Tom says she fell out twice, god was

a tool on him from work. They ask if his job is a burglar. He says no. They
find money on him and he says he wants it back because it's his pay. They broke
into the kitchen and trashed the place. The floor is covered with food and
stuff they threw - fries, mustard and ketchup sprayed on all the walls. The
thief Robert says his buddy is Rick, but he doesn't know his last name of where
he lives. Mike says then it will all go on him. If he thinks of anything, let
him know. (8:20 PM Domestic Dispute) Hillsborough County Sheriff's Department -
Deputy Mike Fields says with any domestic it's difficult to tell the players
without a score card. There are usually lots of people involved, with lots of
ways they think it's supposed to be and they all think they are right. He says
it's in the Suitcase City area where everyone moves around so much. There is
another cop there and a Chevy Caprice in the driveway. The call is the husband
is harassing her by pulling up and knocking on the door. Deputy Jeff Samberg is
there. David says she is 29 and he goes to church and he's trying to get her to
come with him and she won't. He doesn't want her to commit adultery again. He
calls her and the family hangs up on him. He hangs out in front of the house
yelling for her to come out. He wants her to come out and he'll buy her
cigarettes and help her out. They are married, but separated. She is obsessive
compulsive and he just wants her to come to counseling with him. He loves
Debbie, wants to take her to dinner, wants to be with his wife on Saturday
night, he'll buy her lobster or shrimp. Mike says he's been there before, knows
they have lots of cats and wonders if his strategy has worked before. It sounds
weird that he's trying to barter with cigarettes and shrimp. The morbidly obese
mother tells him she doesn't want him around anymore. If he comes back he'll be
arrested for trespassing. They write it up. Debbie comes out, is taller than
David and asks if he has any cigarettes on him. She can't leave because she
doesn't trust him, he'll hurt her. He says he'll never hurt her. Robin filed
the trespass, not her. He has to pick her up in the street then. She says
she'll go with him and talk, she owes him that much. First no one wanted to be
around, then they are leaving together. Mike says that's the first time he
heard that one work, from now on he'll send people to Red Lobster with a
coupon. (9:06 PM) Officer John Hocker says the only calls his squad answers on
the radio are fatal accidents or damage to a city vehicle. There are certain
times of the year they focus on DUIs like the holidays, around now. He has a
mounted camera he can turn on if he sees someone driving erratically - don't
drink and drive or he'll get you. Officer Tim Grams wants to do a field
sobriety test and he needs John to come there with the camera to record it. Tim
demonstrates how he wants him to walk - 9-10 steps heel to toe. Mr. Lee walks 6
steps, almost falls over and says you got me on that one. He is arrested. John
spots a car driving all over the road on Independence and Memorial. The guy
gets out and he asks him to see his license. He says he doesn't have it with
him. He has one, then admits he doesn't have one. He doesn't know why, then he
says it's suspended. John says he was weaving. He says his girlfriend is horny,
was grabbing on him and he only had 8 beers. The woman says she only had a
couple. John takes him to the station to give him a breathalizer test and
Officer Lyman D. Graham tests him. He has to blow into a tube hard for about 15
seconds. Impaired is point .10, his first is point .11 and his second is .10 so
he's legally impaired. They go to take his picture and arrest him. It will be
$500 to bond him out. The guy shakes John's hand and says he wants to thank him
for treating him like a gentleman, he appreciates it. John thanks him. He says
he was a real nice guy and it makes him feel bad to put him in jail, but nice
guys can still kill people.

Trafficking Interdiction Squad - Agent Tom Moorehead says this will be a search
warrant on a ranch they were at last year where 2700 pounds of pot were seized.
Ernie is the main player, got caught in CA with 100 pounds years ago. They saw
a ton, he's moving out and needs to unload it. The squad arms up and most have
their faces hidden. A surveillance team checks out the ranch for people or
suspicious activity. Tom's biggest fear is the weed is gone. You file your
paperwork and hope it's still there. They are in the middle of the desert, the
nearest house is 7 miles away and backup is 1 hour away. He calls the team and
he spots two men going in and out of a trailer, 6 subjects total no weapons.
(5:18 PM Warrant Served) They pour in with assault weapons and tell the guys to
go down, but they don't listen. One guy runs and they search a trailer for him.
They put bags over the criminals heads. They only find a few hundred pounds of
drugs, it's like having a date with Bo Derek and getting Olive Oyl when you
show up. One guy says it's not his house and he's mirandized. The guy says
Brian offered him a large sum of money to stay in the trailer, doesn't know how
much. A UC tells Tom who was going in and out, no one pulled up the whole time.

looking for work, only her, her husband and Dan are in there. The husband says
his plans were to feed the snake and put him in the box in his truck. He wanted
to keep him warm and he was playing with him on the floor all night. He wants
to show Gary. He just did it, milked it, a diamondback with 5 rattles and he
has a degree from the University of Hawaii. He opens a box, it's 4 and 1/2 feet
long and rattling, but he's not breaking law as long as he keeps it in a box.
He asks what's going on. Roy explains if he goes back inside there's no
problem. He asks Roy if he wants to see him milk it. Roy doesn't. He says he's
a long haul cross-country truck driver who used to own 7 pet shops. It got so
lonely it was like doing time, so he got a woman. (4:10 PM Roll Call) Sgt. Pat
Walters says there's a note about Xmas open house 12/20, flyers are distributed

**Tucson, AZ 2** (9:48 PM Shooting Call) Officer Terri O'Rourke says she always
wanted to be a cop since 7th 8th grade. They asked her what she wanted to do
with her life and they laughed at her because there weren't a lot of female
cops. It was always something she was interested in, so she did it. A call of
someone who got shot and 3 men left the scene in a yellow car comes in. She
pulls up and there is a lot of commotion, lots of cops, Fire Dept and people
yelling. A black guy thought they were playing, then they grabbed his neck, put
a gun to his throat and said you wanna shoot? So they shot at them. They come
there to visit Bertha at her apartment all the time. They are two brothers and
can ID the shooters. The big guy Willie got hit with shrapnel. Willie says he
and his brother were coming downstairs and they were approached. A guy was
making noise, they were playing, then the woman driving the car started calling
them niggers. They drive back to the scene where the three Mexican males are
caught. The are juveniles ages 16 & 18. Willie says that's them, but he doesn't
know who shot him. There is a pair of guns on the seat of their car. Willie
went in for surgery, but there was no bullet inside of him, it only grazed him.
He'll be in the hospital a few days. One is arrested for assault and the rest
are pending. (Street Patrol) Officer Gary Lynch says he is very active in his
church and feels sorry for a lot of the people he deals with and understands a
lot of the problems they have. When he first contacts them his whole rapport is
he doesn't have to fight or arrest them. He doesn't want to do it, if he is
calm and polite then they'll give him the same respect. (10:12 PM Domestic
Dispute) A call of a family fight at a neighbor's house. They hear noises, no
other info. They go up to the apartment complex and knock on the door with a
Merry Christmas sign on it. The woman is below, says it's her apt. The guy was
punching the wall and said he was going to kill her. Her 8 month old baby is in
there and she is crying that her kids are freezing. Gary says to drop the kids
at a neighbors' until they can get it sorted out. He's been drinking, just got
home from a bar, has a knife and told her he would kill himself. Gary wants to
ask the manager for a key, but she doesn't want him to do that. He told her if
she called the cops he would shoot her. Gary says he might not mean that. She
says he means it. A neighbor comes to take the kid. She says they have no phone
and it's apt 38, so he goes to the manager. The man says he needs his wife. She
gives them a key that should work. He goes and tries the key, but it doesn't
work. They go to maintenance and get a ladder to climb up on the balcony to get
in the sliding glass door. They get in and call for Danny and get no answer.
Gary grabs the baby out of the crib while other cops search for him. He hands
the baby to the fat mother who is busy smoking and hits the kid with the
cigarette. Danny's hand is cut open, he says it's from hitting a glass picture
and wants a cigarette. He's under arrest. Paramedics are going to check him out
first. She is upset, can't believe he is going along with it. He's been
arrested for domestic before and so has she, it's nothing new to her. (8:04 PM
Burglary Call) Officer Steve McGuigan says the public perceives them as being
different, cold hearted and mean, but they are people too who grew up the same
as everyone else. When they get off the job they all do different kinds of
things and people perceive them differently. He goes to a park at night and
plays basketball with young kids. He hits a shot and says they owe him a dollar
and he'll be back for it. Another unit spotted a suspect, doesn't know what for
yet and he drives over to assist. The apartment was burgled and they got a good
boot print on the door and fingerprints. He's now supposed to be at the Red Dog
drinking. They'll have the victim call him at the bar and make sure he is there
so they can bust him. The guy says he stole a microwave and some 8 track tapes.
The guy says he got all belligerent and he needed to leave. He calls to talk to
Richard and says to go out by the phone, he's got his money, he'll be there in
5 minutes. They drive there, but have no probable cause so they will just
interview him and see what he says. They find him walking into the bar and he
agrees to talk. He's all nice and turns over a pocket knife. He says he worked
phone sales for the guy. He checks his boots and says they scuff nice. He says
he kicked the door a couple days ago and denies knowing anything about a
microwave or 8 track tapes and doesn't know they had that. It's Friday, he
kicked the door on Wednesday. He agrees to go over there and talk to the guy.
He's not mad about the money. They tell him witnesses say the door was clean
yesterday, so he's under arrest, put the cigarette out. He kicked it Wed or
Thurs. They find the stolen stuff behind a bush and want to check it for prints
first. Forensics arrives to dust for prints and finds good prints on the door
and the property. He then admits he stole the stuff at 5-6pm and stashed it. He
has no electricity, so he was holding it for ransom until he got the $16 back
he owed him.

numbers shaved off. Guns and dope always are together. They catch another group
of people including Denise who is crying she came there with her dad. They
check a girls' eyes and ask when was the last time she used speed. She denies
it and is only 16, so they arrest her for being under the influence. Denise
says she didn't do speed, her pupils are huge because she's scared. They say it
doesn't work that way, so she says she smoked pot. Mom arrives and tells the 16
year old that she played with a rattlesnake and got bit. She says mom, not now.

lived there and no one stays with them. She thinks Carlos their neighbor was
home, but doesn't know if he saw anything. They came over to borrow a chainsaw
from her dad, knocked, no one answer, the door was unlocked, so they went
around back and heard the dogs barking. She saw Carla there, couldn't get the
phone to work, so she went next door. Tom tells her to hang tough, but she asks
about her dad. He doesn't want to say, but admits he was found shot in the
bedroom and he's dead. She breaks down. Tom says he hates this, there's no
reason they should be dead. (6:52 PM Homicide Investigation) Detective Fred
Breitkreuz says the back door was pried open, so that's where they'll start.

says it's illegal for him to have sex with her. He knows, but she insisted
saying she was ready. He didn't want to at first, but she assured him no one
would find out. He says she wasn't drunk last night and he bought her an
expensive ring. She says she loves him a lot, doesn't care if she got pregnant
and wants kids. He asked for the ring back after what she did last night. Then
she got mad and accused him of rape last night. He has two marks on his neck,
she gave him a hickey and he gave one back. He says if it's love age shouldn't

the windows in and took off. She saw him throw a ladder through a window and
broke three others and the air conditioner. She was over his house and her car
died and he left her there. They pushed the car to Circle K and the tow truck
driver brought her home. He did it because he was drunk and thinks she's
screwing around with the neighbor. They have two kids together and her
grandfather lives with her and Eugene explains to her what to do if she wants

Haley questions him. The drunk says that his girlfriend got him disappointed

way he is that's the way it's gonna be! That's the way he grew up and that's
the way it's gonna be. He gets angry. You don't know where he grew up or where
comes from. You don't and nobody else will. It makes him mad. He's worse than
Rambo. He doesn't use a gun. He's the only one who can change it. He doesn't
smoke crack. He is an alcoholic, he drinks the cheap whiskey. He is dying
anyway of cirrhosis of the liver, but no one believes him. He's been through a
stomach staple, he's been through hell, more than Rambo. He can't stop, he
can't stop today, why should he? He ain't never tried to kill anyone or hurt
anyone, he did break some teenie windows. Whenever he gets out he's not going
to stop. As long as she treats him wrong he'll treat her like sh-t. If she
treats him right, he'll treat her right. They've been together for 4 years. He
has 2 kids - 2 years and 4 months and 8 months. He hopes his kids see this so
they'll be worse than him. He knows his one boy will be worse, he hopes he is.
A man won't take sh-t from a woman. He doesn't want people messing with him
when he has a good time. He says he doesn't drink that much, when someone gets
him pissed off he gets pissed off. Jim asks shim if he wants help for his
drinking. He says he doesn't need help, he just pissed off, it would be
throwing money out the window. He cries and says he loves his kids, he could've

Any time they go with a report of a gun and do not know if the suspect is still on scene, mentally they have to be prepared, have to make it a safe situation. Any call could be a gun battle or a tussle. (Communication Center) A 9 year old boy calls in that his father is stopping a burglar, but doesn’t know his address. The father comes back and says he shot the guy in his barbershop. They drive over to 1626, pass right by and go in reverse. They jump out into North Philly Cuts & Fades and when they get inside they hear shots. A man yells, “Get out of my face you bitch!” They tell him to come out. The guy keeps saying, “I said!” as there are sounds of a struggle. He yells “kill me!” again and again. He’s at the top of the steps in the back where the man lives and is naked. They yell to put the gun down and come out, but have to go up and get him. The guy says, “I’m through, put it in the paper!’ again and again. He struggles, tries to bite them and they can’t hold him down because he’s too slippery from sweat and blood. He gets up and almost gets out the door by running and crawling. They hit him with a metal chair, pull him down and lose their cuffs. They go to cuff him again and Sgt. Raymond Convery calls for a wagon. He’s shot in the arm and spurting blood all over. The two guys were shooting at each other upstairs. If they shot at the cops they would’ve shot back, unfortunately the victim might’ve gotten shot. The naked guy is the burglar, the victim owns the barbershop and lives above it. He doesn’t know the suspect. He fired at him. He’s all wet and bloody, nothing to hold on to, they don’t know what’s in his blood, don’t want it on them, but have to get it on you to lock him up. (5:43 PM Assistance Call) 25th District - Officer Christine Couter says it was a nice neighborhood a long time ago, before the drugs. Now with the drugs there it’s gotten bad, they’ll steal anything to get money to get high, like TV’s for $2. So many people there who have nothing, no license, no ID and cars that are wrecked. Some people are good, just stuck there. You can’t find out who they are, it’s overwhelming and can’t take them to jail just to find out who they are. Officer Luis Colon says the Sgt. called to look for a blue Monte Carlo. They spot the car down the road, go to cut him off and he crashes right into their police car. The guy is totally high, says he isn’t and they know him. The front of his car is totally wrecked from crashing into other cars. He knows Luis and calls him by name. The victim says he jumped in his car and took off. He has to fill out paperwork before he can get it back. He hit 2-3 cars and has lots of front end damage. He says that’s why he has insurance. He is Middle Eastern, doesn’t know the guy, it was a few blocks away where it happened. He left his keys in the car and went in a store. The guy just took it, couldn’t drive because he was impaired. The Sgt. knew he couldn’t drive, but didn’t know it was stolen. The suspect doesn’t even know his own name. They take him to the station. Sgt. Victor Ramirez says he came wrong way down a one way with people chasing him, yelling at him to stop. He saw him crash head on into a vehicle at a stop sign. They asked him why he was out of it and he said he did 3 bags of Angel Dust. They put him in the wagon and his pants are falling down. (9:17 PM) 4th District - Officer Daniel O’Brien says it’s a high narcotics area, so he looks for drug deals and stolen cars. It’s the first of the month, social security checks are in, so he’s also looking for strong arm robberies. Officer Michael Gormley says a girl looks like she’s dong a deal. An undercover says she went in to buy drugs and they are waiting for her to come out. They spot two car thieves in 2 separate cars and follow them to see what they are up to. One is a yellow Toyota. They lose one, think he went west on Shrieve to get the girl. The other car has a passenger and goes south on 3rd. Two of the police cars are undercover. Joe is at Fourth and Rutner. The car goes into the gas station on Front. A bus stops and they hide behind him at Gagliardi’s. Dan gets out of the car, walks to the bus, light a cigarette and tells them he’s moving north on front. They filled up, snuck out the back and picked up another guy. They follow them as they stop and break into a car on 3rd and McKean. Dan gets out and takes one guy down. Mike helps him cuff Joe on the street. Joe says he didn’t break into no car and repeats it 3 more times. The other unit spots a car just like it on 2nd. He popped the window and was trying to pop the steering column with a screwdriver when he caught him. A wagon arrives and they put him. He stole numerous cars and will be spending July 4th behind bars. **Note:** rumor has it the man in the barbershop was a premed college student with no criminal history. Someone slipped PCP into his food, he was trying to get help and he went crazy. On the way to the station his heart exploded and he died.

He was getting chased and ran home, then ran here so the guys wouldn't catch him. There is garbage and stuff all over the place. The son shows up. Terry says he was scared, seems gay, ask the neighbors, didn't know why there were chasing him or who they are. He doesn't care what they do to him, so they won't get him now. He has a drug that's new to the streets, he didn't know they were police. Leon says he couldn't look out the window and see 15 police cars out there? He doesn't care what they say, he'll look good riding in a wagon. Leon says he'll get his wish. Terry says there's some kind of psycho, mentally disturbed.

**Coast to Coast 44** (Pierce County WA - 3:59 AM Vehicle Pursuit) Sheriff's Dept South Hill Precinct - Deputy Eric Carlson is trying to catch up to other units who have been pursuing a vehicle for 10 minutes. They are going to PIT him if the speeds are right. The suspects’ Honda tires are shredding as he takes an exit ramp, he goes over the grass, back onto the road, plays chicken with a car on 54th, then drives through a park and out the back into a residential area. He takes a couple of turns then goes on sidewalk and back into the park. Eric can't follow as they bail out of the car. A K-9 catches Richard the driver. Sgt. Paul Schneider says he was so stupid and almost killed his friends who were throwing stereo equipment out the windows. Richard says they have the wrong guy since he was just sitting on his porch. They ask him why he's sweating so hard then. He says the cops scratched him up and dragged him over there. Officer Tim Mallon of the Puyallup PD saw them unloading stereo equipment out of a store. They threw stereos at him while he chased him and took out his lightbar. They've been in the pursuit since it started and know it was him. Richard keeps interrupting them and won't listen and says he's having an asthma attack and needs an ambulance. Paul says they have a hospital at the jail and asks where his inhaler is. He says it's in the car which isn't his, he has his own car, not this one. They say the story is getting old and they are done. It wasn't hard to catch him since no one else was on the road. (Albuquerque, NM - 10:35 PM Officer Assistance Call) Southeast Area Command - Officer Heather Hindi has been working there for three years, before that she met her husband who wasn't fond of female officers which was their first argument. Now that they are married he won't start that and she'll always win. There is a traffic stop at a hotel. The driver is Scott who is very manly, but is dressed as a woman in a blond wig and a glove missing fingers. Officer Chris George questions him. She pulls out Adam the Mexican passenger who says she was going to take him home, but he didn't know her. Scott drops stuff and is taken out for a drunk test, standing on one foot then goes back in the car. Adam says he's known her for three months, but doesn't know her name. He doesn't know Scott is a man. They don't believe his story and know they just met. They show him Scott's license listing him as a male. He says, “Oh wow!" They ask if he wants a cab because he could've gotten robbed or worse, but he wants to ride with Scott. Scott gets a failure to yield ticket for $53. He lives out of state and they will pick him up because of the way he's dressed. They've seen it before where a guy pretending to be a woman takes someone home and there are fights and stabbings. (Miami, FL - 9:35 PM Street Patrol) North District - Officer Rick Martinez started going to college to be a lawyer then decided he wanted to be on the other side catching the guys. He applied and that was 12 years ago. An area called Edison is a high drug area and it's hard to catch dealers because of the narrow alleys they run in and hide. He spots a big black guy, Jerome, in an American flag doorag and gives chase. They corner him so he gives up. They cuff him, arrest him. And find crack cocaine nearby. He's got a Jamaican accent and says he ran because he was scared and the drugs aren't his. A guy was fighting with his girlfriend and she put his clothes in the garbage can. He says the drugs aren't his, but he's been arrested for possession before. Rick asks what's up with him tossing the drugs like a football right in front of him. Jerome wants to know what he's being charged with. His story doesn't make sense, if he's in a fight why is he running toward her. He says he ran because he thought his girlfriend called the cops. If you have more than three bags on you it's possession with intent to sell and he has 15 bags on him. He keeps saying it's not his. He knows the game and will probably be back on the streets tomorrow doing the same thing.

admit after they are told they could be held for obstruction if the Mexican
woman was driving. Officer Rodger Leach questions her. Vivian cries and won't
admit she was driving, then finally admits she drove the car and hit her
boyfriend who left. She wasn't drinking. He jumped out of the car when they
were arguing. She put the car in reverse and hit him by hitting the gas by
mistake. She was scared, has two kids at home and is arrested for obstruction
by lying at first and now is in a heap of trouble. San Bernardino County CA -
Rancho Cucamonga PD. Deputy Joe Braaten has been with Sheriff's Dept for over 6
years and wanted a career that was challenging and different every day. Other
jobs didn't do it for him. He did a couple ride alongs with buddies and liked
it. (12:32 AM Traffic Stop) He pulls over a car that has month old expired
tags. Angela the driver says it's in the mail and has a pot pipe right in plain
sight. He asks her how much weed she smoked tonight. She says none. He says she
is lying. She says she doesn't have any pot in the car and wasn't smoking it.
He checks her eyes and she's stoned. The pipe is next to a bag of cookies and
there is a meth pipe too. She says there is nothing else that she knows off. He
keeps looking and finds a speed straw. Deputy Scott Gould backs him up. She
admits to him she used it a few hours ago. It was her first time in a while. He
arrests her to wake her up since she has no previous arrests, no job and still
lives at home. He tells her this stuff will destroy her and she seems like a
nice person. She cries. (Fox Mistakenly Lists this as Bad Girls! 4)
